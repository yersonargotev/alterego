  "marketPositioning": "jf is a command-line utility written in Rust designed specifically for flattening JSON data. It transforms nested JSON objects and arrays into a single-level structure, where keys are typically concatenated paths to the original values. This simplified format is particularly useful for processing JSON with traditional line-oriented Unix tools, importing data into tabular formats like CSV or databases, or generating flat configuration files. Developed in Rust, jf aims to provide a fast, efficient, and reliable solution for this common JSON manipulation task, offering a lightweight alternative to more general-purpose JSON processors or language-specific libraries, and enabling easy integration into shell scripts and automated workflows without external language runtime dependencies."
