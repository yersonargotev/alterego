  "marketPositioning": "adsb_deku is positioned as a niche, lightweight, and performance-oriented open-source ADS-B decoder for users who prefer a terminal-based experience. Its unique selling proposition is the TUI radar display, distinguishing it from the prevalent web-based graphical interfaces of most competitors. It serves the segment of users who need a simple decoder or one that integrates into command-line workflows, rather than a full-featured flight tracking platform feeder with a web UI."
