*   **ADSBExchange Receiver Software:** Software/scripts for feeding data to ADSBExchange, often leveraging dump1090-fa.
    *   Name: ADSBExchange Receiver Software / Feeder
    *   Licensing: Often utilizes open-source components like dump1090-fa. Feeding scripts themselves might be open or provided by ADSBExchange. Docker images are available and open source.
    *   Supported platforms: Linux (Raspberry Pi, x86), Docker.
    *   Main features: Decodes ADS-B/Mode S (using dump1090-fa or readsb), feeds data to ADSBExchange (known for not filtering military/private flights by default), MLAT participation.
    *   Website URL: `https://www.adsbexchange.com/feeding/`

5.  **Identify Most Well-Known Alternative:**
    The most well-known and widely used alternatives overall are the large commercial flight tracking platforms that also provide receiver/feeder software: FlightAware and FlightRadar24. These companies have extensive global networks of receivers and are popular with the general public for viewing flight data via their websites and mobile apps.

6.  **Analyze Market Positioning:**
    `adsb_deku` is positioned as a lightweight, self-hosted, open-source ADS-B decoder and TUI radar application. Its key differentiator is the use of a Text User Interface (TUI) for displaying radar information directly in the terminal, which is less common compared to the web-based graphical interfaces offered by most alternatives (like dump1090's built-in web server, PiAware's SkyAware, or Tar1090). It's written in Rust, which suggests a focus on performance, memory safety, and reliability. While it decodes ADS-B, its lack of an integrated web map or feeding capabilities (as a core feature) places it in a niche for users who prefer a command-line experience or who want a decoder to pipe data to other tools. It contrasts with the more comprehensive, often web-focused, and sometimes proprietary solutions offered by major flight tracking companies (FlightAware, FlightRadar24) or even other open-source projects that prioritize a graphical web interface (Tar1090, dump1090's web UI). Its TUI makes it suitable for headless servers or users who prefer working in a terminal environment.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    adsb_deku is an open-source ADS-B decoder and monitoring tool implemented in Rust. It enables users to receive and decode 1090MHz ADS-B signals from aircraft using compatible hardware (like RTL-SDR dongles). Unlike many other ADS-B receivers that provide a web-based graphical map interface, adsb_deku uniquely offers a Text User Interface (TUI) radar display directly in the terminal. This makes it particularly well-suited for users who prefer a command-line environment or are running on systems without a graphical display, such as headless Raspberry Pi setups. It focuses on efficient decoding and a clear, interactive text-based visualization of nearby aircraft and their data.
