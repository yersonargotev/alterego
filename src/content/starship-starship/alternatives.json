  "marketPositioning": "Starship is positioned as a high-performance, universal command-line prompt that works across any shell and operating system. Its key strength lies in providing a consistent, fast, and highly customizable experience as a single binary written in Rust, differentiating it from shell-specific frameworks like Oh My Zsh or Powerlevel10k (Zsh) and Oh My Fish or Tide (Fish), or Python-based cross-application tools like Powerline. It targets users who value speed, portability across different shell environments, and a rich, context-aware prompt display without the need for complex, shell-dependent configurations."
