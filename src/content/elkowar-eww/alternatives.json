  "marketPositioning": "Eww is positioned as a modern, highly flexible, and window-manager-agnostic widget system for Linux. Unlike traditional status bars (Polybar, Waybar) or purely system-monitoring tools (Conky), eww emphasizes deep visual customization and the ability to create complex, arbitrary graphical elements using a declarative configuration language and CSS. This places it as a powerful tool for users seeking detailed desktop personalization beyond standard panels, offering more layout freedom than typical bars while providing a more modern configuration approach compared to older tools like Conky or Screenlets. Its support for both X11 and Wayland is a key advantage in the evolving Linux desktop landscape."
