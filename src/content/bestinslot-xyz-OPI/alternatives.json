  "marketPositioning": "OPI positions itself as a comprehensive, modular, and open-source indexing client specifically designed to handle the increasing diversity of meta-protocols emerging on the Bitcoin blockchain. By building on the foundational 'ord' indexer and offering a modular architecture, it aims to be a versatile tool for indexing various protocols like BRC-20, Runes, and others. Its open-source nature differentiates it from proprietary API providers, while its focus on multiple meta-protocols and the inclusion of a light client option distinguish it from indexers focused on a single protocol."
