  "marketPositioning": "Nervos CKB positions itself as a highly secure, decentralized, and flexible layer-1 blockchain rooted in Proof-of-Work and a modified UTXO model, offering Turing-complete smart contracts and native account abstraction. While addressing general blockchain scalability and interoperability, a key differentiator and emerging focus is its role as a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution, aiming to bring greater programmability and scalability to the Bitcoin ecosystem without relying on traditional cross-chain bridges. This contrasts with alternatives like Ethereum (Proof-of-Stake, account model, broad dApp ecosystem), Solana (high speed, low cost, Proof-of-History), and Polkadot (interoperability between distinct chains)."
