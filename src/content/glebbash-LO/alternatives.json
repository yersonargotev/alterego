  "marketPositioning": "LO is positioned as a minimalist programming language for WebAssembly development, prioritizing extreme simplicity, ease of understanding, and a small toolchain footprint over the extensive features and ecosystems offered by more established languages like Rust, C++, or Go. It targets developers who need a straightforward path to creating small, dependency-light WASM modules, potentially for educational purposes, micro-scripting within WASM, or resource-constrained environments where complexity and binary size are critical concerns."
