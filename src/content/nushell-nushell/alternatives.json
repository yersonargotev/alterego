  "marketPositioning": "Nushell is positioned as a modern, cross-platform shell and scripting language that stands apart from traditional text-based shells (like Bash, Zsh, Fish) by focusing on structured data pipelines. It competes with object-based shells like PowerShell but draws on a wider range of inspirations (functional programming, modern CLI tools) to offer enhanced usability, clearer errors, and native support for various data formats, aiming to be a more user-friendly and flexible environment for interacting with the operating system and processing data."
