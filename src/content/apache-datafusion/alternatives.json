  "marketPositioning": "Apache DataFusion is positioned as a high-performance, embeddable, and extensible SQL query engine written in Rust and deeply integrated with Apache Arrow. Unlike full database systems or distributed processing frameworks, DataFusion serves as a foundational library for developers to build custom data processing systems and applications. Its focus on embeddability, performance from Rust, and interoperability via Arrow distinguishes it from more monolithic or system-level alternatives. It targets developers who need a powerful query execution core within their own applications."
