  "marketPositioning": "SQLSync is positioned as an open-source, developer-centric solution for building collaborative, offline-first web and edge applications that leverage the familiarity and ubiquity of SQLite. It differentiates itself by providing a robust, eventually consistent synchronization engine inspired by Git and distributed systems, specifically tailored for synchronizing SQLite databases across diverse environments. While other tools offer offline-first and synchronization capabilities (e.g., Firebase, Realm, Couchbase Lite), SQLSync's unique selling proposition lies in its open-source nature, its deep integration with SQLite, and its novel approach to synchronization, making it a compelling choice for developers seeking fine-grained control and a performant, collaborative data layer built around a well-established database engine."
