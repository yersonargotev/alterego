  "marketPositioning": "Candy is positioned as a modern functional programming language aiming for a balance of power and developer-friendliness. It emphasizes being robust, minimalistic, and expressive, potentially targeting developers who find traditional purely functional languages challenging or multi-paradigm languages overly complex. Its focus on simplicity and a pleasant developer experience differentiates it from more academic or ecosystem-bound functional languages."
