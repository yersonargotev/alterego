  "marketPositioning": "Airmail is positioned as a lightweight, pure Rust geocoding library. It targets developers within the Rust ecosystem who require in-application geocoding without the need to integrate with external services or manage separate server-based geocoding instances like Nominatim or Photon. Its focus on being lightweight and pure Rust differentiates it from language-agnostic APIs (Google, Mapbox) and libraries in other languages (GeoPy), emphasizing performance, memory safety, and seamless integration within Rust projects. While it may not offer the extensive global data coverage or advanced features of large commercial APIs, its appeal lies in providing a native, efficient geocoding solution for Rust applications."
