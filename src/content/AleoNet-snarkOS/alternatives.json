  "marketPositioning": "snarkOS positions itself as a Layer 1 decentralized operating system specifically built for zero-knowledge applications, forming the core of the Aleo network. Unlike Layer 2 ZK-rollups that scale existing chains like Ethereum, snarkOS aims to provide a native, privacy-focused, and programmable environment optimized for ZK computations from the ground up. It competes directly with other Layer 1 blockchains emphasizing privacy and ZK technology, and indirectly with Layer 2 ZK solutions that offer scalability and privacy features on established networks."
