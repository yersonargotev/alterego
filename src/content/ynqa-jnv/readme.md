1.  **Key Information Extraction:**
    *   Project Name: "jnv"
    *   Description: "interactive JSON filter using jq"
    *   Main Features: Interactive JSON viewer and jq filter editor, syntax highlighting for JSON, uses `jaq` to apply filters, configurable via TOML, supports various input formats (file, stdin, JSON Lines), auto-completion for basic `jq` features, hint message for filter evaluation.

2.  **Project Purpose:**
    Based on the description and features, the purpose of `jnv` is to provide a user-friendly, interactive command-line interface for exploring, viewing, and filtering JSON data using the power of `jq` expressions. It aims to make working with JSON on the command line more intuitive than using `jq` directly.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Alternatives:**
    Since `jnv` is an interactive command-line tool for JSON processing with `jq`, alternatives would include other command-line JSON tools, particularly those with interactive capabilities or those that offer a different approach to querying/filtering JSON. This could include the original `jq` itself, other interactive JSON viewers, and tools that use different query languages or paradigms.

4.  **Research and List Alternative Tools:**

    *   **jq:** The original command-line JSON processor that `jnv` builds upon. It's a powerful, functional language for slicing, filtering, mapping, and transforming JSON data.
    *   **fx:** A terminal JSON viewer & processor that uses JavaScript expressions for filtering and transformation. It offers an interactive mode for viewing and a non-interactive mode for processing.
    *   **VisiData:** While not solely focused on JSON, VisiData is a powerful interactive multitool for tabular data that can handle various formats, including JSON. It provides a spreadsheet-like interface in the terminal for exploring, filtering, and analyzing data.
    *   **jiq:** Mentioned as an inspiration for `jnv`, `jiq` is another visual command-line interactive JSON explorer with `jq` filters.

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on general awareness and widespread use in scripting and command-line workflows for JSON processing, the original `jq` is likely the most well-known and widely used alternative overall.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    `jnv` positions itself as an "interactive JSON filter using jq". Its key differentiator is the combination of an interactive viewer with a `jq` filter editor, making the process of building and testing `jq` queries more visual and immediate than using `jq` directly in a pipeline. It leverages the power of `jq` but wraps it in a more user-friendly terminal UI. Compared to `fx`, which uses JavaScript for filtering, `jnv` specifically targets users familiar with or wanting to use the `jq` language. Compared to VisiData, which is a broader data exploration tool, `jnv` is specialized for JSON and integrates deeply with the `jq` filtering paradigm. Its use of `jaq` (a Rust implementation of `jq`) is also a notable technical detail.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    jnv is an interactive command-line tool designed for seamlessly exploring and filtering JSON data using the powerful `jq` query language. It provides a terminal-based interactive JSON viewer alongside a `jq` filter editor, allowing users to visually navigate JSON structures and build and test `jq` expressions in real-time. The tool offers features like syntax highlighting for JSON, auto-completion for common `jq` patterns, and the ability to handle various input formats, including files and standard input, supporting both single JSON objects and streams like JSON Lines. By integrating `jaq` internally, `jnv` simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need for a separate `jq` installation while providing a fast and often more correct implementation of the `jq` language.
