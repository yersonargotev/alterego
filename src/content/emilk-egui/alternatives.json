  "marketPositioning": "egui is positioned as an easy-to-use, immediate mode GUI library for Rust developers. Its core value proposition lies in combining the benefits of the immediate mode paradigm (simplicity for certain use cases like tools and debugging) with the performance and safety guarantees of Rust. It stands out from larger, retained-mode frameworks like Qt or GTK by offering a different UI programming model and a focus on simplicity. Compared to other Rust GUI toolkits, its immediate mode nature and strong web support are key differentiators. It competes with immediate mode libraries like dear imgui but offers a native Rust implementation. Its cross-platform capability, especially supporting both native and web from a single codebase, makes it a compelling choice for developers seeking a straightforward, performant, and versatile GUI solution in the Rust ecosystem."
