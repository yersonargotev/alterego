  "marketPositioning": "Martin is positioned as a high-performance, lightweight, and versatile open-source tile server. Its key differentiators are its focus on speed and efficiency, support for a combination of popular geospatial tile formats (MBtiles, PMtiles) and dynamic PostGIS serving within a single tool, and inclusion of MBtiles tooling. It competes with more comprehensive open-source GIS servers by offering a simpler, faster alternative specifically for tile delivery and with commercial tile services by providing a free, self-hostable option with strong performance."
