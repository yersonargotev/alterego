  "marketPositioning": "Project Oak positions itself as a foundational software platform for building distributed systems with a strong emphasis on meaningful data control and verifiable system behavior. Unlike some confidential computing solutions that primarily focus on protecting data in use within enclaves, Oak adds a layer of transparency and verifiability, allowing external parties to gain confidence in the computation's integrity and correctness within a distributed environment. This unique focus on verifiable claims about system behavior, in addition to data privacy, sets it apart from general-purpose confidential computing SDKs or cloud offerings and positions it for use cases requiring a higher level of trust and auditability in distributed data processing."
