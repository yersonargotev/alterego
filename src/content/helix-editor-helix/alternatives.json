  "marketPositioning": "Helix positions itself as a \"post-modern modal text editor,\" directly competing with traditional modal editors like Vim and Neovim by offering a modern, opinionated take on the paradigm with built-in features and a simpler configuration philosophy. It targets users who value the efficiency of modal editing but desire a more streamlined and feature-rich out-of-the-box experience. While not directly competing with mainstream GUI editors like VS Code or Sublime Text in terms of interface or extensibility model, it offers a powerful keyboard-centric alternative for developers seeking a different workflow."
