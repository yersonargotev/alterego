  "marketPositioning": "SurrealDB positions itself as a unified, end-to-end database platform that simplifies the technology stack for developers building modern, real-time applications. By natively supporting multiple data models (document, graph, etc.) and incorporating real-time capabilities and access control directly into the database, it aims to reduce the need for multiple databases and complex backend logic. Its SQL-like query language makes it accessible, while its flexible deployment options (embedded, server, distributed, cloud) cater to various use cases. It competes with specialized databases by offering a broader, integrated feature set in a single product."
