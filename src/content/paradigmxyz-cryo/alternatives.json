  "marketPositioning": "cryo positions itself as a high-performance, flexible data extraction tool for blockchain data, focusing on providing raw or structured data in common formats (parquet, csv, json, dataframes) for developers and researchers. Unlike end-to-end analytics platforms or indexing protocols that offer querying APIs, cryo specializes in the initial data fetching phase. Its command-line and Python interfaces, combined with Rust's performance, make it suitable for programmatic access and large-scale data processing, filling a niche for users who need to integrate blockchain data into their existing data pipelines and analysis workflows.",
  "expandedDescription": "cryo is a powerful and flexible open-source command-line interface and Python library built in Rust, designed to streamline the extraction of blockchain data from various EVM-compatible networks. It provides developers, data scientists, and researchers with an efficient way to fetch raw or structured blockchain information, including blocks, transactions, logs, and traces. Unlike platforms focused on analysis or indexed querying, cryo specializes in the crucial data extraction step, outputting data directly into widely compatible formats such as Parquet, CSV, JSON, and native Python dataframes (Pandas, Polars). This allows seamless integration with existing data analysis pipelines and tools. With extensive options for filtering by block ranges, contract addresses, specific columns, or event signatures, and the ability to manage request rates for third-party RPC providers, cryo offers granular control and high performance for accessing and processing large volumes of on-chain data."
