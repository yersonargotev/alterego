  "marketPositioning": "Quickwit positions itself as a cloud-native, open-source search engine specifically designed for the demanding requirements of observability data (logs and traces). It differentiates itself from traditional search engines like Elasticsearch/OpenSearch and log aggregation systems like Loki by its unique architecture that leverages cost-efficient cloud object storage for primary data residency while still providing sub-second search latency. Unlike proprietary, comprehensive platforms such as Datadog and Splunk, Quickwit offers a purely open-source alternative with a focus on optimizing performance and cost for petabyte-scale immutable data in cloud environments. Its Elasticsearch-compatible API aims to ease migration for users of the Elastic Stack, while native OpenTelemetry and Jaeger support cater directly to the observability ecosystem. Quickwit competes on the basis of its cloud-native efficiency, cost savings through object storage, and a truly open-source license in a market increasingly dominated by source-available or proprietary licenses."
