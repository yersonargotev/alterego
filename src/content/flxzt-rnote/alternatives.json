  "marketPositioning": "Rnote is positioned as a free and open-source alternative in the digital note-taking and sketching market. It differentiates itself by focusing on a robust, vector-based inking experience optimized for stylus input across multiple desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). While lacking some advanced features found in proprietary competitors like comprehensive OCR, audio sync, or extensive cloud ecosystems, rnote appeals to users who prioritize open-source software, customization, and a dedicated drawing/inking tool with flexible canvas options, offering a compelling choice outside the dominant commercial offerings."
