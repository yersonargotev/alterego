  "marketPositioning": "IKV-store positions itself as a highly specialized, high-performance embedded key-value store specifically for Machine Learning inference workloads. It differentiates itself from traditional network-based stores like Redis and Memcached by offering zero-latency reads through its embedded architecture and leveraging local infrastructure. While RocksDB is also embedded and persistent, IKV-store emphasizes ease of management with a fully-managed persistent data plane and read optimizations that avoid LSM tree compaction concerns. Its core value proposition is significantly faster and more cost-effective data access for ML models compared to general-purpose key-value solutions."
