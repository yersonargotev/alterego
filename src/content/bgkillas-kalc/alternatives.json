  "marketPositioning": "kalc is positioned as a powerful, open-source scientific calculator focusing on a terminal user interface (TUI). It targets users who need advanced mathematical capabilities, including complex numbers, vector/matrix operations, arbitrary precision, and 2D/3D graphing, all accessible from the command line. While more comprehensive mathematical software like MATLAB, Octave, or the Python scientific stack offer similar computational power and graphing (usually in a GUI or scripting environment), and TUI calculators like Kalker provide a command-line interface with some advanced features, kalc carves a niche by combining a rich set of advanced mathematical functions and graphing within a performant, real-time TUI, distinguishing itself from both simpler TUI calculators and more complex, GUI-dependent mathematical environments."
