  "marketPositioning": "Gdext is positioned as a high-performance, type-safe, and scalable alternative scripting/extension language for Godot Engine 4, specifically for developers who prefer Rust or require its unique guarantees regarding memory safety and concurrency. It competes with C++ GDExtension for performance-critical tasks and with C# for developers seeking a more robust type system and better performance than GDScript, offering Rust's distinct advantages within the Godot ecosystem. Its market is developers already familiar with or interested in Rust and using Godot, providing a means to combine Godot's rapid development features with Rust's system-level control and safety."
