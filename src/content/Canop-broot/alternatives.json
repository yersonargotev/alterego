  "marketPositioning": "broot is positioned as a modern, interactive command-line file manager that provides a visually intuitive tree-like view of the file system. It differentiates itself from traditional command-line tools by integrating navigation, search, and file management in a single interface, offering a more engaging user experience. Compared to other terminal file managers, broot's strength lies in its interactive tree visualization and efficient fuzzy search for quick exploration and file discovery within deep directory structures. It serves users who prefer the command line but desire a more visual and interactive file management experience than is typically offered by standard tools."
