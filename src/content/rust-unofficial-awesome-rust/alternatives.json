  "marketPositioning": "Awesome-rust positions itself as a high-level, community-curated entry point into the Rust ecosystem. It complements official resources like crates.io and the Rust documentation by providing a filtered, subjectively 'awesome' collection of projects and resources across various categories. Its strength lies in its human-powered curation, offering a more guided discovery experience compared to the exhaustive search capabilities of package registries. It is particularly valuable for users looking for recommended and established solutions or wanting to explore the breadth of what's available in Rust in an organized manner."
