  "marketPositioning": "Rolldown is positioned as a high-performance, Rust-based JavaScript and TypeScript bundler that offers a compelling combination of speed (similar to esbuild) and ecosystem compatibility (leveraging Rollup's API and plugins). Its primary strategic positioning is as the future core bundler for the Vite build tool, providing a faster underlying build experience for Vite users. Additionally, it aims to serve as a standalone bundler, potentially replacing Rollup for users seeking speed improvements or offering an esbuild alternative with more flexible chunking control. Its key differentiator is the blend of Rust-powered speed with strong compatibility with the established Rollup ecosystem."
