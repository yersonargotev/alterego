  "marketPositioning": "Ninjabook is positioned as a high-performance, lightweight, and low-level library for handling core financial market data structures, specifically Level 2 order books and trades. By being written in Rust, it targets developers who require maximum speed, efficiency, and control over memory management for building performance-critical trading applications or market data infrastructure. It serves as a fundamental building block, distinct from broader quantitative finance libraries, time-series databases, or full-fledged commercial matching engines."
