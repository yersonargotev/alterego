  "marketPositioning": "LSP-AI is positioned as a flexible, open-source language server backend for AI-powered code assistance. Unlike many proprietary AI coding tools that target specific popular IDEs, LSP-AI leverages the Language Server Protocol to offer broad compatibility with any LSP-supported editor. It differentiates itself by abstracting the complexities of integrating various LLM backends and focusing on empowering developers with core AI features like completion and chat within their preferred, potentially less mainstream, coding environments. Its open-source nature and emphasis on being a backend layer make it a foundational tool for those seeking customizable and editor-agnostic AI integration."
