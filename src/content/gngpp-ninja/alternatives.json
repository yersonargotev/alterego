  "marketPositioning": "\"ninja\" is positioned as an unofficial, free alternative for developers needing programmatic access to ChatGPT by reverse-engineering its public web interface. This contrasts with the official paid OpenAI API and LLM gateways that provide unified access to multiple models. Its niche is users prioritizing free access via the web method, accepting the risks associated with an unstable, undocumented interface, rather than a robust, officially supported API or a general-purpose LLM management tool."
