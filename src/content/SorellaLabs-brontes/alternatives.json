  "projectPurpose": "To provide a high-performance, modular, and programmable engine for general blockchain data analysis, with a specific focus on systematic detection and analysis of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) within the Ethereum ecosystem.",
  "platforms": [
    "Likely Linux/macOS (as a Rust application, requires compilation and running locally or on a server)"
  ],
  "mainFeatures": [
    "Transforms raw Ethereum data into a structured, analyzable format",
    "Enhances analysis with off-chain data (metadata, CEX prices, p2p data)",
    "Provides a modular framework for implementing user-defined custom analytics (inspectors)",
    "Built on top of Reth for performance",
    "Specialized in systematic MEV detection"

  "marketPositioning": "Brontes is positioned as a high-performance, developer-focused blockchain analytics engine, distinguishing itself with a specific emphasis on systematic MEV detection and a modular architecture built on Rust and Reth. Unlike broader, UI-centric platforms like Dune Analytics or Nansen, brontes targets users who need programmatic control and the ability to build custom analysis workflows for complex on-chain data and MEV strategies. While EigenPhi also specializes in MEV, brontes appears to offer a more foundational engine for custom development rather than primarily providing pre-packaged dashboards and data feeds. Its focus on speed, raw data transformation, and off-chain data integration caters to researchers and developers tackling the challenges of large-scale, low-level blockchain data analysis and sophisticated MEV analysis."
