  "marketPositioning": "Gleam is positioned as a friendly, type-safe language for building scalable systems, likely targeting the Erlang VM. Its market position is distinct from other BEAM languages like Erlang and Elixir due to its static type system, and it differentiates itself from other type-safe languages like Rust and Scala by emphasizing friendliness and potentially leveraging the BEAM's inherent strengths in concurrency and fault tolerance for scalable applications."
