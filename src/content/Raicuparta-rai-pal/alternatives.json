  "marketPositioning": "Rai Pal occupies a niche market position by focusing exclusively on \"universal game mods\" \u2013 modifications designed to function across multiple games, often leveraging common game engines. While general mod managers like Vortex and Mod Organizer 2 support multiple games, their primary function revolves around managing game-specific mod lists. Rai Pal differentiates itself by providing a dedicated tool for discovering, installing, and managing this specific class of mods, particularly highlighting its utility for universal VR mods like UEVR. It serves a distinct need for users interested in applying engine-level modifications across their game libraries, rather than managing individual mod collections for separate titles."
