  "marketPositioning": "Wasmi is positioned as an efficient, lightweight, and secure WebAssembly interpreter focused on constrained and embedded systems. It differentiates itself from JIT/AOT-based runtimes by prioritizing fast startup times, low memory overhead, deterministic execution, and suitability for environments where JIT compilation is not feasible or desired. It targets use cases like embedded devices, IoT, and blockchain smart contracts, offering a reliable and resource-conscious Wasm execution environment, sometimes serving as a drop-in alternative or prototyping tool to runtimes like Wasmtime in specific contexts."
