  "marketPositioning": "Vello is positioned as a cutting-edge, experimental 2D graphics rendering engine that differentiates itself through a strong emphasis on GPU compute for maximizing performance on modern hardware, particularly for complex scenes. It aims to be a high-performance alternative to more traditional renderers like Skia and Cairo, offering a modern, Rust-based implementation built on the portable wgpu API. Its focus is on pushing the boundaries of what's possible with GPU-accelerated 2D graphics by offloading core rendering tasks to compute shaders."
