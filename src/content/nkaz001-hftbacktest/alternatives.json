  "marketPositioning": "Hftbacktest is positioned as a specialized, open-source tool for high-frequency trading and market-making strategy development. Unlike many general-purpose backtesting frameworks, it places a strong emphasis on simulating market microstructure at the tick level, accurately accounting for factors like order book depth, queue position, and latency. This detailed approach, coupled with its support for both Python (with Numba acceleration) and Rust for performance, and the inclusion of live trading bot capabilities, makes it particularly suitable for quantitative traders and developers requiring high-fidelity simulations for HFT and market-making strategies, especially within the cryptocurrency domain as demonstrated by its examples. Its open-source nature provides transparency and flexibility compared to proprietary institutional solutions."
