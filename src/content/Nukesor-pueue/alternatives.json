  ],
  "marketPositioning": "Pueue is positioned as a modern, feature-rich command-line task management tool that provides a robust queuing system for shell commands. It sits between basic scheduling tools like 'at'/'batch' and full-fledged job schedulers, offering more control over concurrency, dependencies, and persistence than simpler alternatives, while focusing on a per-user, single-system model. Its key differentiators compared to direct competitors like Task Spooler include features like task grouping, callbacks, and JSON output, along with being written in Rust."
