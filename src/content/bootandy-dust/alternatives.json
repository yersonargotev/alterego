  "marketPositioning": "dust is positioned as a modern, command-line disk usage analyzer that aims to be a more intuitive and visually appealing replacement for the standard `du` utility. By providing a tree-like structure with graphical bars and colors directly in the terminal, it offers a better user experience than the raw output of `du`. It differentiates itself from interactive tools like `ncdu` by focusing on a clear, static output designed for quick overview rather than interactive navigation. Its implementation in Rust emphasizes performance and modern software development practices."
