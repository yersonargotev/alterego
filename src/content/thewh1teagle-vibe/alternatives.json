  "marketPositioning": "\"vibe\" is positioned as a user-controlled, privacy-centric desktop application for audio transcription. By performing transcription locally, it directly addresses concerns users might have about sending sensitive audio data to cloud-based services like Otter.ai. While it likely utilizes underlying open-source models akin to or including aspects of OpenAI Whisper or VOSK, its market position is as a user-friendly application layer that prioritizes the 'on your own' aspect, offering an alternative to both technical command-line tools and proprietary cloud platforms."
