  "marketPositioning": "Anchor is positioned as the leading high-level framework for building programs on the Solana blockchain. It simplifies and accelerates development by providing abstractions and tools that reduce boilerplate compared to native Rust development. It serves a similar purpose to well-known smart contract frameworks on other blockchains like Ethereum's Hardhat and Truffle, but is specifically designed for Solana's unique architecture and Rust-based development environment. Anchor is widely recommended for both beginners and experienced developers in the Solana ecosystem."
