  "marketPositioning": "sshx is positioned as a fast, secure, and highly collaborative open-source solution for sharing terminal sessions over the web. Its core strength lies in providing a rich, real-time collaborative experience directly in the browser for guests, featuring elements like multiple terminals on an infinite canvas, remote cursors, and chat, which differentiate it from simpler terminal sharing tools. Unlike IDE-integrated solutions like VS Code Live Share or proprietary terminals like Warp, sshx offers web-based access for collaborators without requiring them to install specific desktop applications. Compared to other open-source terminal sharing tools like tmate or tty-share, sshx emphasizes a more interactive and visually rich web interface designed specifically for multiple participants working together. It targets developers, educators, and support teams needing a simple yet powerful way to share and collaborate on command-line tasks remotely."
