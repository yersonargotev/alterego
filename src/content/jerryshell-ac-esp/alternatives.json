  "marketPositioning": "ac-esp is a highly specific tool targeting the game AssaultCube. Its market positioning is not as a general-purpose game hacking tool, but rather as a dedicated hack for a particular game and as a potential learning resource for implementing game cheats in Rust. It exists within the niche community of AssaultCube modding and game hacking enthusiasts interested in Rust development, contrasting with broader tools like Cheat Engine or comprehensive reverse engineering platforms like Ghidra and IDA Pro."
