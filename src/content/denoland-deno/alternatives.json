  "marketPositioning": "Deno positions itself as a modern and secure alternative to Node.js, emphasizing security by default, native TypeScript support, decentralized module management via URLs, and adherence to web standards. It aims to address perceived limitations of Node.js and provide a simpler, more streamlined developer experience out-of-the-box compared to the extensive setup often required with Node.js and its ecosystem tools. While Node.js benefits from a vast and mature ecosystem, Deno targets developers prioritizing a secure, modern, and opinionated runtime environment."
