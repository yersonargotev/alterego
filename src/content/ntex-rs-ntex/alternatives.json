  "marketPositioning": "ntex is positioned as a flexible and high-performance framework for building a wide variety of composable networking services in Rust. Unlike web-specific frameworks that primarily focus on HTTP, ntex offers broader support for different network protocols (including MQTT, AMQP, and gRPC) and the flexibility to integrate with multiple asynchronous runtimes. This makes it suitable for diverse network applications beyond traditional web services, competing with general-purpose networking frameworks in other languages (like Netty) while leveraging Rust's strengths. Within the Rust ecosystem, it differentiates itself by providing a more protocol-agnostic and runtime-flexible foundation compared to frameworks tightly coupled to HTTP or a specific runtime."
