  "marketPositioning": "TiKV is positioned as a robust, open-source, cloud-native distributed transactional key-value database. It serves as a foundational storage layer for building highly scalable and consistent databases (like TiDB) and stateful applications. Unlike simpler key-value stores focused primarily on coordination (like etcd or Consul), TiKV emphasizes strong transactional guarantees and the ability to handle large datasets with high throughput. Compared to distributed SQL databases (like CockroachDB), TiKV operates at a lower level, providing the transactional KV engine rather than a full SQL interface. Its open-source nature, CNCF graduation, and Rust implementation highlight its alignment with modern cloud-native development practices."
