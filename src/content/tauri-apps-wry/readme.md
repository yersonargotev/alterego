        *   Licensing: ISC license
        *   Supported platforms: macOS (WebKit), Linux (WebKitGTK), Windows (MSHTML) - Note: Wry uses `webview2-com` on Windows for WebView2 (Edge Chromium), while this older `webview` crate used MSHTML.
        *   Main features: Embeds native WebView, call Rust from JavaScript and vice versa, compile to a small binary, controllable window properties, embeddable content.
        *   Website URL: https://crates.io/crates/webview (Crate registry page) or https://github.com/zserge/webview (Underlying C library)

5.  **Identify the most well-known or widely used alternative:**
    Based on common knowledge and search results mentioning its widespread use in popular applications like VS Code, Slack, and others, **Electron** is likely the most well-known and widely used alternative.

6.  **Analyze the market positioning:**
    Wry positions itself as a *cross-platform WebView library in Rust*. Its key differentiators are:
    *   **Built in Rust:** This offers potential advantages in terms of performance, memory safety, and creating smaller binaries compared to frameworks based on heavier runtimes like Node.js and embedded Chromium (e.g., Electron, NW.js).
    *   **Utilizes Native WebViews:** Unlike Electron or NW.js which bundle a full Chromium instance, Wry uses the operating system's built-in WebView component (WebView2 on Windows, WebKit on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux). This contributes significantly to smaller application sizes and potentially lower resource usage. However, this can lead to some inconsistencies in rendering or behavior across platforms.
    *   **Core component for Tauri:** Wry is explicitly mentioned as being "for Tauri," indicating its role as a foundational library within the Tauri ecosystem, which focuses on building secure, lightweight, and performant desktop applications using web technologies.

    Compared to alternatives:
    *   Vs. Electron/NW.js: Wry offers smaller binary sizes, lower resource usage, and potentially better security by leveraging native WebViews and Rust. However, Electron and NW.js provide a more consistent rendering experience across platforms due to the bundled Chromium and have a larger, more mature ecosystem and easier entry point for web developers due to Node.js integration.
    *   Vs. CEF: CEF is a C++ framework for embedding Chromium, offering deep customization but also complexity. Wry provides a Rust interface and leverages native WebViews, aiming for a potentially simpler developer experience within the Rust ecosystem while avoiding the large Chromium dependency of CEF.
    *   Vs. Qt WebEngine: Qt WebEngine is part of the larger Qt framework and is also based on Chromium. Wry is a more focused library specifically for WebViews in Rust, independent of the full Qt framework.
    *   Vs. `webview` crate: Wry appears to be a more actively maintained and feature-rich successor or alternative in the Rust ecosystem for cross-platform WebViews, particularly given its association with Tauri and support for modern WebViews like WebView2.

    Wry is positioned as a core building block for developers who prioritize performance, small binary size, security, and building applications primarily in Rust, particularly within the context of the Tauri framework. It trades some cross-platform rendering consistency (inherent to using native WebViews) for these benefits.

7.  **Expanded description:**
    Wry is a cross-platform WebView rendering library written in Rust. It provides a lightweight and unified interface to embed web content (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) within native desktop applications by leveraging the operating system's native WebView components (such as WebView2 on Windows, WebKit on macOS, and WebKitGTK on Linux). As a foundational component of the Tauri framework, Wry enables developers to build performant, secure, and significantly smaller desktop applications compared to frameworks that bundle a full web browser engine. It offers features like custom protocol handling and file drop support, allowing for close integration between the web frontend and the native backend written in Rust. Wry is designed for developers who need fine-grained control over the WebView and prioritize minimal overhead and binary size.
