  "marketPositioning": "ncspot is positioned as a lightweight, cross-platform Spotify client for users who prefer a terminal-based interface. It competes within the niche of command-line Spotify clients, offering direct audio streaming unlike some alternatives that require a separate playback daemon. Its use of Rust emphasizes performance and efficiency, appealing to users seeking an alternative to more resource-intensive GUI clients. It caters specifically to users comfortable with an ncurses interface, providing a fast and keyboard-driven way to interact with Spotify."
