  "marketPositioning": "BitVM is positioned as a novel paradigm for enabling complex, Turing-complete smart contracts on Bitcoin by shifting computation off-chain and using the Bitcoin network for verification through an optimistic rollup-like mechanism. Unlike other solutions that create separate blockchains or sidechains, BitVM aims to leverage Bitcoin's existing security and decentralization directly without requiring changes to its core protocol. This positions it as a potentially more trust-minimized way to bring advanced programmability to Bitcoin compared to alternative Layer 2s or sidechains, although its complexity and reliance on a prover-verifier model present different trade-offs."
