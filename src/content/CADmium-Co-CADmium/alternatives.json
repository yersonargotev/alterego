  "marketPositioning": "CADmium positions itself as a free and open-source, local-first CAD program running directly in the browser. This distinguishes it from proprietary web-based CAD solutions like Onshape (full-featured, subscription-based) and Tinkercad (beginner-focused, free), as well as desktop open-source options like FreeCAD and LibreCAD. Its key market differentiator is the combination of open-source freedom and the accessibility and convenience of a pure web application that aims to perform computations client-side using modern technologies like Rust and WebAssembly."
