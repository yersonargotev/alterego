5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on market presence, professional use, and general recognition, **Onshape** is likely the most well-known and widely used *purely browser-based* professional CAD alternative. Autodesk's offerings like **Fusion 360** and **AutoCAD** are also extremely well-known in the broader CAD market and offer browser access or viewers. However, Onshape's core identity is centered around its cloud-native, browser-based approach.

6.  **Market Positioning Analysis:**
    CADmium positions itself as an "open-source CAD program that runs in the browser". This immediately places it in a niche that combines two key aspects: open-source licensing and web-based accessibility.

    *   **Compared to Proprietary Web CAD (Onshape, Tinkercad, AutoCAD Web, Fusion 360 Web):** CADmium's open-source nature is its primary differentiator. While proprietary options like Onshape offer robust features and collaboration, they come with subscription costs. Tinkercad is free but more geared towards beginners and simpler designs. AutoCAD Web and Fusion 360 Web offer browser access but are often tied to existing desktop subscriptions or provide a more limited feature set in the browser compared to their desktop counterparts. CADmium aims to provide a full CAD experience directly in the browser without licensing fees.
    *   **Compared to Desktop Open-Source CAD (FreeCAD, LibreCAD):** FreeCAD and LibreCAD are powerful open-source desktop applications. Their main limitation compared to CADmium is the requirement for installation and lack of inherent web accessibility. CADmium's browser-based nature eliminates installation barriers and allows access from any device with a modern browser.
    *   **Compared to Other Open-Source Web CAD (Chili3D, OpenJSCAD.org):** CADmium competes more directly with tools like Chili3D and OpenJSCAD.org. Its specific features and the underlying technologies (Rust, WebAssembly) would determine its competitive edge within this smaller niche. OpenJSCAD.org is script-based, which appeals to a different user base than a more traditional GUI-based CAD like CADmium appears to be. Chili3D is also browser-based and open-source, making it a very close competitor.

    CADmium's unique selling proposition is its combination of being fully open-source and running entirely within the browser, leveraging technologies like Rust and WebAssembly for performance. This allows for a "local-first" experience within the browser, unlike some cloud-streaming approaches. It targets users who want the freedom and transparency of open-source software coupled with the accessibility and convenience of a web application. Its market positioning is as an emerging open-source, local-first, browser-based parametric 3D CAD modeler.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    CADmium is an ambitious open-source project building a full-featured Computer-Aided Design (CAD) program designed to run directly within a web browser. Leveraging modern web technologies like WebAssembly (compiled from Rust), CADmium aims to provide a "local-first" CAD experience that is both accessible from anywhere and performs computations client-side, offering potential advantages in responsiveness and offline capabilities compared to cloud-streaming alternatives. It seeks to offer robust 3D parametric modeling tools typically found in desktop CAD software but with the convenience of a web application, positioning itself as a powerful, free, and open alternative in the evolving landscape of cloud and web-based CAD.
