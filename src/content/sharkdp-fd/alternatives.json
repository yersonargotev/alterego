  "marketPositioning": "fd positions itself as a modern, faster, and more user-friendly alternative to the traditional 'find' command. It sacrifices some of the advanced complexity and extensive options of 'find' for simplicity, speed, and better default behavior, making it ideal for everyday file searching tasks. Compared to 'locate', it performs real-time filesystem searches with greater accuracy, while still being significantly faster than 'find' for most common use cases."
