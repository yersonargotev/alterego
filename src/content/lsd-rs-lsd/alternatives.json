It competes with other modern alternatives like exa and eza by heavily emphasizing visual enhancements such as extensive coloring and icons, aiming to make terminal file listing more intuitive and easier to read. While offering core 'ls' functionality and modern features like tree view, its primary market position is as a 'deluxe' interactive command for users who prioritize clarity and visual feedback in their terminal workflow."
