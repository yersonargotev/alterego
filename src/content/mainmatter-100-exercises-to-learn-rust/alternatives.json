  "marketPositioning": "\"100-exercises-to-learn-rust\" is positioned as a focused, exercise-first, self-paced resource for learning Rust. It complements official documentation like 'The Rust Book' and 'Rust By Example' by providing a large, structured set of hands-on coding challenges. Compared to 'Rustlings', it offers a different collection of exercises and relies solely on the GitHub repository structure rather than a dedicated command-line tool. Its market niche is learners who prefer a direct, code-heavy approach to mastering Rust fundamentals outside of a fully interactive online environment, valuing the ability to work locally through a substantial number of practical examples."
