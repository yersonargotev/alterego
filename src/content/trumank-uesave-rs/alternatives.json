  "marketPositioning": "uesave-rs is an open-source library written in Rust specifically targeting developers and modders who need programmatic access to Unreal Engine save files (GVAS). Its position is distinct from graphical save editors by providing a library for building custom tools and integrations within the Rust ecosystem. Compared to libraries in other languages, it leverages Rust's performance and safety features. The included JSON conversion utility makes it a versatile tool for both automated processing and human-assisted editing workflows."
