  "marketPositioning": "The `soroban-example-dapp` is positioned as a key resource for developers to explore and build on Stellar's new Soroban smart contract platform. While Stellar has historically focused on payments and asset transfers, Soroban expands its capabilities into the broader decentralized application space, including DeFi. This positions Stellar as a growing competitor to established smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain by offering a Rust and WASM-based alternative with a focus on performance, sustainability, and security, leveraging Stellar's existing network strengths."
