  "marketPositioning": "AppFlowy-Cloud is positioned as the leading open-source, AI-enhanced collaborative workspace alternative to proprietary tools like Notion. Its core value proposition lies in offering a feature-rich platform for project management, wikis, and team collaboration, combined with the crucial advantage of user data control inherent in its open-source nature. It competes directly with broad productivity tools but differentiates by catering specifically to users and organizations prioritizing data privacy, transparency, and the ability to self-host or customize."
