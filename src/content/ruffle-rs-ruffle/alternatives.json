  "marketPositioning": "Ruffle is positioned as the leading open-source, safe, and modern Flash Player emulator for the post-Flash era. Its use of Rust and WebAssembly provides strong security guarantees and broad compatibility across modern browsers and operating systems, including seamless web integration. While BlueMaxima's Flashpoint is a prominent project focused on archiving and offline playback of a vast library of web content (including Flash), Ruffle is the primary technology enabling the *emulation* of SWF content directly within current computing environments, making it the preferred choice for websites and platforms (like the Internet Archive and Newgrounds) seeking to make existing Flash content accessible again without security risks."
