  "marketPositioning": "cs2-dumper is a highly specialized open-source tool positioned within the Counter-Strike 2 reverse engineering and tool development community. Its unique value proposition lies in its specific focus on automating the extraction of game-specific memory offsets and interfaces for CS2 on both Windows and Linux, powered by memflow. This contrasts with more general-purpose reverse engineering and memory analysis tools that require significant manual effort to achieve the same result for a specific game like CS2. It serves a niche but crucial need for developers and researchers targeting this particular game."
