  "marketPositioning": "xh is positioned as a performant and user-friendly command-line HTTP client. It directly competes with other CLI tools like curl and HTTPie, aiming to offer a faster alternative to HTTPie while retaining its intuitive syntax. Its key advantages are its speed due to being written in Rust and its easy distribution as a single binary. It serves developers and system administrators who prioritize command-line workflows, speed, and ease of installation over the graphical interfaces offered by tools like Postman and Insomnia."
