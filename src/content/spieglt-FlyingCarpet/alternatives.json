  "marketPositioning": "FlyingCarpet is positioned as a privacy-focused, open-source, and truly cross-platform alternative to Apple's AirDrop. Its key differentiator is the ability to create and utilize an ad hoc WiFi network for direct device-to-device file transfer, even when no existing router or network infrastructure is available. This distinguishes it from many alternatives like LocalSend and ShareDrop, which primarily rely on a shared local network. While Nearby Share/Quick Share also offers direct connection capabilities, FlyingCarpet provides a consistent application experience across a broader range of desktop and mobile operating systems, including Linux."
