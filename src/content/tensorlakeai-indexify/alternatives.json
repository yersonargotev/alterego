  "marketPositioning": "Indexify positions itself not merely as a vector database or an extraction tool, but as an open-source, real-time engine that orchestrates the entire pipeline for processing, indexing, and serving unstructured data specifically for GenAI applications and agent workflows. Its core value proposition lies in simplifying the creation and deployment of complex, multi-stage data extraction and indexing workflows, acting as the connective tissue between raw unstructured data, AI models, and various storage backends (including vector databases). It focuses on providing a unified, scalable, and real-time infrastructure layer for data-intensive AI applications, abstracting away much of the underlying data plumbing complexity."
