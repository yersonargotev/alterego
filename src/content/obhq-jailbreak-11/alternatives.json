  "marketPositioning": "jailbreak-11 is positioned as an experimental, foundational tool for achieving the initial jailbreak on PS4 firmware 11.00 and lower. It likely implements a specific exploit (such as PPPwn) to gain system access. Unlike more comprehensive tools like GoldHEN that provide a full suite of post-exploit features (homebrew enabling, debug settings, etc.), jailbreak-11's primary focus is the exploit itself, serving as the necessary precursor for loading such payloads."
