  "marketPositioning": "Serde is positioned as the foundational, high-performance, and type-safe serialization and deserialization framework for the Rust ecosystem. It distinguishes itself through its generic architecture, which offloads format-specific logic to external crates, fostering a rich ecosystem. This allows Rust developers to seamlessly work with a wide variety of data formats while benefiting from Rust's performance characteristics and compile-time safety guarantees. Unlike language-specific libraries that might be tied to a particular format like JSON (e.g., Jackson, Json.NET), Serde provides a format-agnostic core. Compared to schema-first systems like Protocol Buffers, Serde offers flexibility in handling diverse and potentially dynamic formats, making it the de facto standard for data serialization within the Rust world."
