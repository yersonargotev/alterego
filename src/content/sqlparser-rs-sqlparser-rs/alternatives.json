  "marketPositioning": "sqlparser-rs is a leading open-source, general-purpose SQL parser library specifically tailored for the Rust programming language ecosystem. It distinguishes itself through a hand-written parser design that prioritizes performance, ease of extension for custom dialects, and simplified debugging compared to parser generators. While it aims for broad ANSI/ISO SQL compliance and dialect support, its primary market position is as a foundational component for building robust and performant data processing tools, databases, and query engines written in Rust, as demonstrated by its adoption in projects like Apache DataFusion and Ballista. It competes with general-purpose parsers in other languages and parser generator tools, but is the prominent choice for Rust developers needing native SQL parsing capabilities."
