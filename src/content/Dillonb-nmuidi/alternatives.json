  "marketPositioning": "nmuidi is positioned as a highly specialized, performance-focused utility for Windows users who need significantly faster directory deletion, particularly for challenging structures like those found in software build environments (deeply nested, many small files). It differentiates itself from general-purpose built-in tools and other utilities by focusing solely on optimizing deletion speed through parallelization, accepting the trade-off of not including safety features like confirmation prompts."
