  "marketPositioning": "Apache DataFusion is positioned as an extensible, high-performance SQL query engine library built in Rust, primarily for developers building new data-centric systems. It differentiates itself through its Rust implementation, tight integration with Apache Arrow, and its focus on providing a customizable core engine that can be embedded or used as a foundation for databases, data lakes, and analytical applications, rather than being a standalone end-user database or a large-scale distributed processing framework like Spark or Trino."
