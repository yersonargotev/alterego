  "marketPositioning": "pgvecto.rs is positioned as a high-performance, scalable vector search extension for PostgreSQL. Its primary market position is to serve users who already use PostgreSQL and want to add advanced vector search and hybrid query capabilities without the complexity of deploying and managing a separate dedicated vector database. It competes with the standard pgvector extension by offering enhanced features, potentially better performance through its Rust implementation, and separate index management. It competes with dedicated vector databases by providing the convenience and architectural simplicity of integrating vector workloads directly into an existing relational database, while aiming to deliver comparable performance and scalability for many use cases."
