  "marketPositioning": "VNT is positioned as a simple and efficient open-source VPN and tunneling tool written in Rust, specifically designed for inter-city networking and intranet penetration. It competes with established VPN solutions like OpenVPN and WireGuard by potentially offering a more modern and efficient implementation, while also providing similar intranet penetration capabilities as tools like ngrok. Compared to mesh networking solutions like Tailscale and ZeroTier, VNT appears to offer a more fundamental tunneling approach, appealing to users who prioritize performance, simplicity, and direct control in an open-source package for connecting distributed networks and bypassing NATs/firewalls."
