  "marketPositioning": "eza is positioned as a modern, actively maintained, and feature-rich replacement for the ubiquitous `ls` command. It differentiates itself from the standard `ls` by providing enhanced visual output (colors, icons), integrating with development workflows (Git status), offering advanced viewing modes (tree view), and presenting more detailed file information in a user-friendly format. As a maintained fork of the popular but unmaintained `exa`, it aims to be the preferred choice for users seeking an updated and actively developed alternative to the traditional file listing utility, competing in the space of 'next-generation' `ls` commands written in performant languages like Rust."
