  "marketPositioning": "tracexec positions itself as a specialized tracing utility focused on the critical and often complex process of program execution initiation via execve system calls and pre-execution steps. While general-purpose tools like strace and bpftrace can also trace these events, tracexec offers a dedicated approach with features like a TUI and debugger launching capabilities, making it particularly suited for debugging build systems, analyzing script behavior, and understanding how software launches programs, providing a more focused and potentially more user-friendly experience for these specific use cases."
