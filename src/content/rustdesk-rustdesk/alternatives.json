  "marketPositioning": "RustDesk is positioned as a privacy-focused, open-source remote desktop solution that directly competes with proprietary tools like TeamViewer and AnyDesk. Its key differentiator is the ability for users to self-host the infrastructure, offering greater control, security, and data privacy compared to reliance on third-party cloud servers. This appeals to users and organizations seeking autonomy and customization, setting it apart from mainstream cloud-based offerings. It stands as a robust open-source alternative alongside options like VNC and Apache Guacamole, aiming for a balance of features, performance, and user-friendliness."
