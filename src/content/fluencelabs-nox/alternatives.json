  "marketPositioning": "nox is a core software component (a peer implementation in Rust) for the Fluence network, which positions itself as the first decentralized 'cloudless' computing platform and a direct alternative to centralized cloud providers. Unlike some decentralized compute projects focused on GPUs, Fluence, and thus nox, emphasizes aggregating and utilizing global CPU capacity for a wide range of serverless applications. nox enables users to participate in this network, contributing to a resilient, auditable, and censorship-resistant infrastructure for decentralized applications, particularly those requiring general-purpose computation rather than specialized GPU tasks."
