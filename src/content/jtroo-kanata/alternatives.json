  "marketPositioning": "kanata positions itself as a free and open-source, cross-platform software-based keyboard remapper that brings advanced customization features typically found in specialized keyboard firmware (like QMK) to any standard keyboard. It offers deep control over key behavior through layering, tap-hold, and complex mappings via a human-readable configuration file. This positions it as a powerful alternative for users on Linux, Windows, and macOS seeking consistent, highly customized keyboard layouts without needing specific hardware, differentiating it from platform-specific tools or more general automation scripting languages."
