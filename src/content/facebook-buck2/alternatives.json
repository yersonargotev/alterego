  "projectName": "buck2",
  "projectPurpose": "Buck2 is a modern, large-scale, and fast open-source build system developed by Meta. Its purpose is to efficiently build software projects, particularly large and polyglot codebases often found in monorepos, by providing a fast, reliable, and extensible platform with features like parallelism, remote execution, and a clear separation of concerns. It aims to improve developer productivity by significantly reducing build times.",

  "marketPositioning": "Buck2 is positioned as a next-generation, large-scale, fast, and reliable build system, directly competing with tools like Bazel and Pants, particularly in the context of large, polyglot monorepos. Its key differentiators include its Rust-based core, clean separation of core and language-specific rules (Starlark), explicit design for remote execution and virtual file systems, a single dependency graph for improved parallelism, and the BXL introspection language. Buck2 leverages lessons from its predecessor Buck1 and provides a migration path, aiming to offer superior performance and extensibility compared to existing solutions for complex build environments."
