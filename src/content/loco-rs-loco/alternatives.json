  "marketPositioning": "Loco is positioned as a productive, focused web framework within the Rust ecosystem. It specifically targets solo developers and startups, aiming to provide a streamlined and efficient experience for building web applications quickly, leveraging Rust's performance and safety while simplifying development complexities. This contrasts with other Rust frameworks that may target broader use cases or require more configuration, and with rapid development frameworks in other languages that don't offer Rust's core advantages."
