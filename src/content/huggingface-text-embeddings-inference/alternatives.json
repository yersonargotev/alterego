  "marketPositioning": "Text Embeddings Inference (TEI) is positioned as a specialized and highly optimized open-source inference solution specifically for text embedding and sequence classification models. Unlike general-purpose model servers, TEI is tailored to the unique demands of these models, focusing on high performance, low latency, and seamless integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem. It competes by offering best-in-class speed and efficiency for its specific domain, making it ideal for applications like semantic search and RAG built upon popular open-source embedding models."
