  "marketPositioning": "Czkawka is positioned as a comprehensive, high-performance, and privacy-focused free and open-source disk cleanup utility. It differentiates itself by offering a wide array of cleaning tools (beyond just exact duplicates to include similar media, broken files, etc.) within a single application, its speed due to being written in Rust with multithreading, and its broad cross-platform support. It competes with both specialized duplicate/similar file finders and more general system optimization tools by providing a versatile and transparent solution for freeing up disk space and organizing files without cost or privacy concerns."
