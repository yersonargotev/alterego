  "marketPositioning": "tracing positions itself as the primary, Rust-native *instrumentation framework* for application-level diagnostics. Unlike full APM suites or distributed tracing backends, it focuses specifically on providing the APIs and tools within Rust to generate structured, temporal, and causal trace data (spans and events). Its strength lies in its deep integration with Rust language features and async runtimes. It does not provide a default collection or visualization backend but offers a flexible 'Subscriber' mechanism and integrations (notably via tracing-opentelemetry) to connect with various logging tools, distributed tracing systems (like Jaeger, Zipkin, Tempo), and commercial APM platforms (like Sentry, Datadog, New Relic). This makes it a foundational layer within the Rust observability ecosystem, designed to produce high-quality telemetry that can be consumed by a wide range of downstream analysis tools."
