  "marketPositioning": "Owshen positions itself as a privacy layer specifically designed for enhancing anonymity and confidentiality within existing blockchain networks, particularly Ethereum, using zero-knowledge proofs. Unlike standalone privacy coins (Monero, Zcash), it aims to bring privacy features to a major established platform. This places it alongside projects like DOP, focusing on providing a privacy-preserving layer on top of existing blockchain infrastructure rather than creating a new chain. Its branding 'The Deep Sea' emphasizes strong, hidden privacy."
