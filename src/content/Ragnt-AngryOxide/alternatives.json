  "marketPositioning": "AngryOxide positions itself as a modern, Rust-based, and highly automated tool for 802.11 penetration testing, with a specific focus on efficiently capturing EAPOL handshakes and PMKIDs for offline cracking. Compared to the Aircrack-ng suite, which offers a broader range of tools requiring manual chaining, AngryOxide aims for a more integrated and streamlined workflow from scanning to handshake capture. While tools like Kismet focus on passive monitoring and discovery, AngryOxide actively performs attacks. Its unique features like EAPOL validation, GPS integration, and Kismet-compatible output, combined with its focus on automation and a modern codebase, position it as a specialized, user-friendly alternative for security professionals and hobbyists focused on Wi-Fi password cracking preparation and network vulnerability identification."
