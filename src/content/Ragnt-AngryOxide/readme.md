2.  **Project Purpose:**

    Based on the description ("802.11 Attack Tool") and features like collecting EAPOL messages and PMKIDs for cracking, performing various Wi-Fi attacks (deauthentication, hidden SSID retrieval), and providing output compatible with tools like Hashcat and Kismet, the project's purpose is to serve as a modern, automated tool for conducting 802.11 wireless network penetration testing and security auditing, specifically focusing on capturing handshake data for offline password cracking and identifying network vulnerabilities.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Alternative Tools:**

    Given AngryOxide's focus on 802.11 attacks, packet capture, and handshake collection for cracking, potential alternatives would be other tools used for wireless network analysis, auditing, and penetration testing. These include well-known suites and individual tools specializing in Wi-Fi attacks and password cracking.

4.  **Research and List Alternative Tools:**

    *   **Aircrack-ng:** A widely recognized suite for Wi-Fi security assessment. It includes tools for monitoring, attacking (deauthentication, replay attacks), testing, and cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2 keys. It's open source and supports multiple platforms.
    *   **Kismet:** Primarily a passive wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. It can identify networks, clients, hidden SSIDs, and basic IDS features. It's open source and runs on Linux, macOS, and has limited Windows support. It focuses more on monitoring and information gathering than active attacks like AngryOxide, though it includes some IDS features and can log in formats compatible with other tools.
    *   **Hashcat:** While not a direct 802.11 attack tool, it's essential for the password cracking step after capturing handshakes. AngryOxide is designed to produce output compatible with Hashcat. Hashcat is a powerful, multi-platform password recovery tool that supports numerous algorithms, including WPA/WPA2. It's open source and leverages CPU/GPU for speed.
    *   **Reaver:** An open-source tool specifically designed for brute-force attacks against Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) vulnerabilities to recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases. It's more specialized than AngryOxide or Aircrack-ng but relevant for WPA/WPA2 key recovery.
    *   **Wifiphisher:** An open-source tool focused on creating rogue access points and performing Wi-Fi phishing attacks to capture credentials. It uses techniques like Evil Twin and KARMA. While it performs Wi-Fi attacks, its primary goal is credential harvesting through phishing, distinct from AngryOxide's focus on handshake capture for offline cracking.

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative Overall:**

    Aircrack-ng is widely considered the most well-known and used suite of tools for wireless security assessment and penetration testing. It's often included in penetration testing distributions like Kali Linux.

6.  **Market Positioning Analysis:**

    AngryOxide positions itself as a modern, automated, and consolidated tool for 802.11 attacks, built in Rust. Its key differentiators appear to be:
    *   **Modern Implementation:** Written in Rust, which is known for memory safety and performance.
    *   **Automation:** Designed for autonomous operation and automated attacks.
    *   **Consolidated Approach:** Aims to provide a "single-interface survey capability with advanced automated attacks".
    *   **Specific Attack Focus:** Strong emphasis on actively retrieving EAPOL messages and PMKIDs for Hashcat cracking.
    *   **Unique Features:** Includes features like EAPOL handshake validation, geofencing, and Kismet-compatible output with GPS.
    *   **Usability:** Offers both a Terminal-UI and a headless mode for flexibility.

    Compared to Aircrack-ng, which is a suite of command-line tools offering a broad range of Wi-Fi attacks and analysis capabilities, AngryOxide seems to offer a more integrated and automated experience, particularly for the task of capturing crackable handshakes. While Aircrack-ng requires users to chain multiple tools (airodump-ng for capture, aireplay-ng for attacks, aircrack-ng for cracking), AngryOxide aims for a more streamlined workflow from scanning to handshake capture.

    Compared to Kismet, which is primarily a passive monitoring and discovery tool, AngryOxide is actively performing attacks. However, AngryOxide's ability to output in Kismet format suggests potential integration or use alongside Kismet for comprehensive analysis.

    Hashcat is complementary, handling the offline cracking that AngryOxide prepares data for. Reaver and Wifiphisher have more specialized attack vectors (WPS brute-force and phishing, respectively) compared to AngryOxide's broader 802.11 attack focus.

    AngryOxide appears to target users who want a more modern, potentially faster (due to Rust), and more automated tool specifically for capturing Wi-Fi handshakes and PMKIDs for cracking, offering a more integrated approach than traditional tool suites while also providing advanced features like GPS integration and handshake validation. Its ongoing "HEAVY development" also indicates a focus on continuous improvement and adding new capabilities.

7.  **Expanded Description:**

    AngryOxide is an open-source 802.11 attack tool written in Rust, designed for wireless network security auditing and penetration testing. It provides a single-interface capability for surveying Wi-Fi networks and executing advanced automated attacks. Its primary goal is to efficiently retrieve relevant EAPOL messages (4-way handshakes) and PMKIDs from access points and clients, producing valid hashlines compatible with password cracking tools like Hashcat. AngryOxide features an active state-based attack engine, flexible targeting and whitelisting options, and an auto-hunt mode for channel scanning. It offers both a Terminal-UI for interactive use and a headless mode suitable for scripting and logging. The tool incorporates EAPOL 4-Way-Handshake validation techniques and rate-limits deauthentication frames to avoid potential issues. It also supports GPS integration, including geofencing and outputting captured frames with embedded GPS data in Kismet-compatible pcapng and kismetdb formats. AngryOxide is under active development, aiming to provide a modern, automated, and efficient alternative for wireless penetration testers focused on handshake and PMKID capture.
