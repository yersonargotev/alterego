  "marketPositioning": "sig is positioned as an interactive command-line grep alternative specifically tailored for handling and searching streaming data in real-time. Unlike traditional grep, which primarily processes static files or finite streams once, sig offers a dynamic interface that allows users to refine searches on live data feeds and provides an archived mode to review recent history. This focus on interactivity with streams differentiates it from faster file searchers like ripgrep and more comprehensive, often GUI-based, log analysis platforms. It aims to provide a lightweight, command-line native solution for a common challenge in development and operations: monitoring and filtering continuous text outputs."
