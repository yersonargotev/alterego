  "marketPositioning": "Mise is positioned as a modern, fast, and unified developer tool that consolidates the functionalities of polyglot version managers (like asdf), environment variable managers (like direnv), and task runners (like Make or npm scripts). Written in Rust for performance, it targets developers working in polyglot environments who seek to simplify their toolchain and environment setup with a single, integrated command-line interface and configuration file, offering an alternative to managing multiple disparate tools."
