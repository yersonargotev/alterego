  "marketPositioning": "Meteroid positions itself as an open-source pricing and billing infrastructure specifically designed for modern software companies, particularly those adopting usage-based billing and product-led growth (PLG) principles. It emphasizes flexibility, extensibility, and the ability to handle complex and evolving pricing models without the limitations and potential vendor lock-in of proprietary SaaS solutions. Its focus on usage-based billing and PLG distinguishes it from some traditional subscription billing platforms. While other open-source options like Kill Bill and Lago exist, Meteroid highlights its modern architecture (Rust-based) and focus on addressing the specific needs of PLG companies. The project is currently in alpha, indicating it's an emerging player in the market aiming to capture businesses looking for a self-hostable, highly customizable, and transparent billing solution."
