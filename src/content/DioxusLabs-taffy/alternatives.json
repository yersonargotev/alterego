  "marketPositioning": "Taffy is positioned as a high-performance, Rust-native UI layout library that differentiates itself by offering comprehensive support for modern CSS layout algorithms (Block, Flexbox, and Grid), unlike some alternatives that focus primarily on Flexbox. It serves as a modular, embeddable engine for other UI frameworks and applications, particularly those within the Rust ecosystem, providing a performant alternative to C++-based engines like Yoga and the integrated layout systems of larger frameworks like Flutter and Qt."
