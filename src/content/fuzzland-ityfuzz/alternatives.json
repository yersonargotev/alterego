  "marketPositioning": "ItyFuzz is positioned as a cutting-edge, blazing-fast bytecode-level hybrid fuzzer for smart contracts. It differentiates itself through its combination of fuzzing and symbolic execution, emphasis on speed and automation (including autonomous exploit generation), ability to handle complex DeFi scenarios, and support for both on-chain and off-chain fuzzing. While competing with established fuzzers like Echidna and integrated testing frameworks like Foundry, ItyFuzz highlights its minimal manual effort requirement and its performance in finding bugs and generating exploits directly from bytecode."
