  "marketPositioning": "Code2prompt is positioned as a focused, flexible, and developer-centric CLI tool specifically for the task of preparing codebase content for consumption by LLMs. Unlike broader AI coding assistants or code analysis platforms, its core strength lies in structuring an entire codebase into a single, templated prompt while providing essential features like token counting and Git integration. This makes it particularly useful for developers who want fine-grained control over the context they provide to LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks, positioning it as a key utility in the emerging workflow of using LLMs for codebase-wide analysis and interaction."
