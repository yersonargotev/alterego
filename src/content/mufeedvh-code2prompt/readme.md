1.  **Key Information Extraction:**

    *   **Project Name:** code2prompt
    *   **Description:** "A CLI tool to convert your codebase into a single LLM prompt with source tree, prompt templating, and token counting."
    *   **Main Features:**
        *   Convert codebases of any size into readable, formatted prompts.
        *   Smart Filtering: Include/exclude files using glob patterns and respect `.gitignore` rules.
        *   Flexible Templating: Customize prompts with Handlebars templates.
        *   Token Tracking: Track token usage to stay within LLM context limits.
        *   Git Integration: Include diffs, logs, and branch comparisons in your prompts.
        *   Developer Experience: Automatic clipboard copy, line numbers, and file organization options.

2.  **Project Purpose:**

    The project's purpose is to streamline and automate the process of preparing codebase content for use with Large Language Models (LLMs). It takes a codebase, structures it with a source tree, filters relevant files, applies templates, and counts tokens, making it easier for developers to feed code into LLMs for tasks like analysis, generation, and documentation.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Alternative Tools:**

    Given the purpose of preparing code for LLMs, alternatives would include tools that help with:
    *   Code summarization for LLMs.
    *   Creating structured representations of codebases.
    *   Tools that facilitate feeding large code contexts to AI.
    *   AI-powered code analysis tools that might have features for summarizing or structuring code.
    *   CLI tools or IDE extensions designed for interacting with LLMs using codebase context.

4.  **Research and List Alternative Tools:**
    Based on search results, several tools offer similar functionality or address related use cases.

    *   **Repomix (formerly Repopack):** A tool that packs a repository into a single file for AI.
    *   **Concat-Proj:** A utility to combine multiple project files into a single text file for AI.
    *   **Prelude:** A simple tool to build LLM prompts from code repositories.
    *   **SnapSource for VS Code:** A VS Code extension to copy file/folder contents and tree structure.
    *   **OpenAI Codex CLI:** An open-source CLI tool from OpenAI that acts as a local coding agent, capable of reading, modifying, and running code, and explaining codebases. While not strictly a *code-to-prompt converter* in the same sense, it handles codebase context for LLM interaction.
    *   **Bito AI:** An AI code assistant with IDE/CLI integration that can review code, generate code, and provide explanations using natural language prompts.
    *   **Codacy:** An AI-powered code review tool that performs static analysis and can incorporate machine learning for pattern detection. While primarily for code review, it involves analyzing and understanding codebase content.
    *   **DeepCode (Snyk Code):** An AI-powered code analysis tool that scans for vulnerabilities and suggests fixes. It uses AI to understand code.

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative Overall:**

    Among the tools that interact with code and AI, **GitHub Copilot** is arguably the most well-known and widely used AI coding assistant, although it functions more as an in-IDE pair programmer rather than a tool for converting an entire codebase into a single prompt. However, if considering tools specifically for interacting with LLMs using codebase context or providing codebase information to AI, **OpenAI Codex CLI** (from OpenAI) is a significant contender due to its origin and capabilities as a local coding agent. Given the specific niche of preparing codebase context for *prompting* LLMs, the landscape is still evolving. Repomix seems to be gaining traction as a direct alternative. For general AI interaction with codebases, commercial tools like GitHub Copilot and products incorporating Snyk/DeepCode are very prominent. Considering the prompt generation aspect, **OpenAI's models accessed via tools like their Codex CLI or integrated into platforms** are widely used for code-related tasks, making tools that facilitate this interaction, like code2prompt and potentially Codex CLI, relevant alternatives. Let's consider OpenAI's offerings as a major player in the space of interacting with code via LLMs.

6.  **Market Positioning:**

    Code2prompt is positioned as a dedicated CLI tool for a specific workflow: preparing a codebase to be ingested by Large Language Models. Its key differentiators appear to be its focus on creating a *single, structured prompt* with a source tree representation, flexible templating for various LLM tasks, precise token counting, and Git integration. While many AI tools *analyze* code or *generate* code snippets, code2prompt focuses on the *input* side for broader codebase analysis or interaction with LLMs. Alternatives often focus on specific tasks like code review (Codacy, DeepCode) or in-IDE assistance (GitHub Copilot, Bito AI). Tools like Repomix and Concat-Proj are more direct competitors in the "prepare codebase for AI" space. Code2prompt's CLI nature and emphasis on templating offer flexibility for users who want to craft custom prompts for different LLM use cases beyond just basic summarization or single-file analysis. Its token tracking is also a crucial feature for managing the context window limitations of LLMs.

7.  **Expanded Description of Code2Prompt:**

    Code2Prompt is a versatile command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of generating structured prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) directly from your codebase. It acts as a code ingestion tool, efficiently converting codebases of any size into a single, formatted output suitable for various LLM tasks such as code analysis, generation, and documentation. Key features include automatic processing, smart filtering of files based on glob patterns and `.gitignore` rules, and flexible prompt customization through Handlebars templating to cater to different use cases. Code2Prompt also incorporates essential developer-centric features like token tracking to manage LLM context limits, Git integration to include diffs and logs, automatic clipboard copying of the generated prompt, and options for including line numbers and organizing files within the output. It aims to eliminate the manual effort of copying and formatting code for LLMs, simplifying the interaction between developers' projects and AI models. Beyond the CLI, Code2Prompt also offers an SDK (Python binding) for integration into AI agents and automation scripts, and can function as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
