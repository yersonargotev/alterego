  "marketPositioning": "insta is positioned as a dedicated snapshot testing library specifically for the Rust programming language. It provides a native and idiomatic solution for Rust developers to easily implement snapshot testing within their projects, focusing purely on this testing paradigm rather than being a general testing framework. Its value lies in bringing a popular and effective testing technique, widely used in other ecosystems like JavaScript (Jest) and .NET (Verify), to the Rust development environment."
