    *   NetworkX (the widely used, but slower, pure Python library that rustworkx is inspired by)
    *   igraph (C library with Python bindings, known for performance)
    *   graph-tool (C++ library with Python bindings, known for performance)
    *   NetworKit (C++ toolkit with Python bindings, focused on large-scale networks and parallelism)
    *   SNAP (C++ library with Python bindings)

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative Overall:**
    Based on the search results and general knowledge within the Python data science community, NetworkX is widely considered the de-facto standard and most well-known graph library in Python, despite its performance limitations compared to compiled alternatives.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    Rustworkx positions itself as a high-performance alternative to pure-Python graph libraries like NetworkX, addressing the performance bottlenecks often encountered in large-scale or computationally intensive graph analysis tasks. Unlike NetworkX, which is written entirely in Python, rustworkx leverages the speed and memory efficiency of Rust. Compared to other high-performance libraries with bindings to C/C++ like igraph and graph-tool, rustworkx aims to provide a similar level of performance while potentially offering a more "Pythonic" feel or specific features advantageous for its primary users (like those in the quantum computing domain, given its origin from Qiskit). It offers a balance between the ease of use associated with Python libraries and the performance of compiled code, without being a direct drop-in replacement for NetworkX. Its implementation in Rust also highlights a focus on memory safety.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    Rustworkx is a general-purpose graph theory library for Python designed with a strong emphasis on performance. Written in Rust, it wraps low-level Rust code to provide fast implementations of graph data structures and a wide array of standard graph algorithms. Inspired by the popular NetworkX library, rustworkx caters to users who require the flexibility of a Python graph library but need to overcome the performance limitations of pure Python implementations for computationally intensive applications or large graphs. It supports the creation and manipulation of various graph types, including directed graphs and multigraphs, and provides algorithms for tasks such as shortest paths, isomorphism, and matching, with support for multithreading. While not a direct drop-in replacement for NetworkX, rustworkx offers a high-performance alternative that is competitive with other compiled graph libraries available for Python.
