  "marketPositioning": "plock is positioned as a minimalist, efficient, and universally accessible tool for interacting with LLMs and custom scripts. Unlike full desktop AI assistants with graphical interfaces, it focuses on providing quick access from any typing context, similar to quick launchers but specifically tailored for querying LLMs and scripts. Its ability to execute arbitrary scripts differentiates it from many LLM-specific tools, offering broader automation potential directly integrated into the user's typing workflow. It stands apart from more established universal launchers by explicitly highlighting LLM interaction as a core feature.",
  "expandedDescription": "From anywhere you can type, plock allows you to instantly query and stream the output of a Large Language Model (LLM) or execute and stream the results of any other script. This tool provides a seamless way to integrate AI capabilities and custom automation directly into your daily workflow, accessible without needing to switch applications or open a dedicated terminal window."
