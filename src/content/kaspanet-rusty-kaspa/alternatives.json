  "marketPositioning": "Rusty Kaspa positions itself as the high-performance, Rust-based reference implementation for the Kaspa network, offering significant technical advantages in efficiency, resource usage (via advanced pruning), and synchronization speed compared to other blockchain full nodes. Its focus on leveraging Rust and providing a robust foundation for the growing Kaspa ecosystem, including seamless integration with web and mobile applications via WASM, differentiates it within the broader landscape of blockchain node software. While not as widely recognized as foundational clients for larger networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, it aims to be the technical standard-bearer for the Kaspa BlockDAG."
