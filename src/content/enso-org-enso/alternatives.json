  "marketPositioning": "Enso occupies a unique position by combining a hybrid visual/textual interface with a functional programming core, specifically targeting data-driven tasks. It differentiates itself from purely textual functional languages by offering visual accessibility and from traditional visual data workflow tools by providing a more general-purpose, deeply integrated programming experience with the benefits of a functional paradigm. It aims to bridge the gap for users who require both the power of code and the intuitiveness of visual design for data transformation and analysis."
