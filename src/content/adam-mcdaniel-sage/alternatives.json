  "marketPositioning": "Sage is positioned as a new, emerging programming language project. Implemented in Rust, it potentially aims for performance and safety. Its 'wise beyond its bytes!' tagline suggests unique design goals or paradigms. It currently stands as an experimental or niche language, exploring new ideas rather than competing directly with established languages on ecosystem or widespread adoption."
