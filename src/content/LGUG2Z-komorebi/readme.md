5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on general awareness and integration into the Windows ecosystem, **Microsoft PowerToys (FancyZones)** is likely the most well-known and widely used alternative for enhanced window management on Windows. It is a Microsoft-backed project and easily accessible to a large number of Windows users.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    komorebi positions itself as a powerful and highly customizable tiling window manager for Windows, specifically targeting users who desire an experience akin to tiling window managers on Linux (like i3 or bspwm). Unlike simpler snapping tools or even FancyZones which focuses more on predefined zones and drag-and-drop, komorebi offers dynamic tiling, a command-line interface for scripting and automation (via tools like AutoHotKey), granular control over windows, workspaces, and monitors, and the ability to define complex custom layouts. Its architecture, separating the core logic from input handling, provides flexibility. While other open-source options exist for Windows tiling, komorebi appears to be one of the more actively developed and feature-rich, particularly in its support for advanced configurations and multi-monitor/workspace management. Its licensing model (Komorebi 2.0.0, a fork of PolyForm Strict 1.0.0), which prohibits commercial use without a specific license, differentiates it from purely open-source alternatives like FancyZones or GlazeWM for business environments.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    komorebi is a tiling window manager designed for Windows 10 and above, functioning as an extension to the native Desktop Window Manager. It provides users with a powerful and flexible way to control application windows, virtual workspaces, and display monitors primarily through a command-line interface. This CLI can be integrated with third-party tools like AutoHotKey, enabling users to define custom keyboard shortcuts for managing windows and layouts. Inspired by tiling window managers on other platforms, komorebi offers features such as dynamic tiling, support for various built-in and custom layouts (definable via JSON or YAML), automatic layout selection based on the number of windows, and fine-grained control over window behavior and placement across multiple monitors and virtual workspaces, treating each monitor as capable of hosting its own set of workspaces. komorebi is built with minimal default modifications to the operating system, allowing users to opt-in to deeper customizations via configuration files. It is licensed under the Komorebi 2.0.0 license, which permits personal use but requires a separate license for commercial use.
