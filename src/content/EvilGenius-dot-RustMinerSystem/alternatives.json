  "marketPositioning": "RustMinerSystem is positioned as a high-performance, Rust-based mining proxy specifically tailored for professional mining farms. It differentiates itself through its emphasis on precise fee sharing ('drawing water'), minimal hashrate loss, and high connection concurrency, aiming to provide a more optimized and stable solution compared to general-purpose miners with proxy features or less specialized proxy software. Its support for a wide range of algorithms expands its appeal across different mining operations. It competes directly with other dedicated mining proxy solutions by focusing on efficiency, stability, and profit optimization critical for large-scale mining."
