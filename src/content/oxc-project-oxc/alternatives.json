  "marketPositioning": "Oxc positions itself as a high-performance, unified toolchain for JavaScript and TypeScript, built in Rust to achieve industry-leading speeds, particularly in parsing. It aims to compete with or replace collections of existing tools (like ESLint, Prettier, Babel, Terser) and other performance-focused toolchains (like SWC and esbuild) by offering a faster, integrated alternative for core development tasks such as linting, formatting, and transpilation. Its focus on a complete, fast suite built on a modern language like Rust is its key differentiator in the market."
