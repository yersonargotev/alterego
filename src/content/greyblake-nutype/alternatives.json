  "marketPositioning": "Nutype is specifically positioned as a tool for implementing the newtype pattern in Rust with strong guarantees. Unlike general validation libraries that validate data after creation, Nutype integrates sanitization and validation directly into the type's construction process using a procedural macro, ensuring that invalid values cannot be created. This focus on compile-time enforcement and integration with type definition sets it apart from broader validation frameworks like `validator` or `garde`, and type-specific solutions like `constrained_int`. Its approach aligns well with domain-driven design by using the type system to enforce business invariants, offering a Rust-native alternative to some aspects of data validation seen in libraries like Pydantic or Zod in other languages."
