  "marketPositioning": "SWC is positioned as a high-performance, Rust-based compiler and minifier for the web, offering significant speed improvements over traditional tools like Babel. While it includes bundling capabilities (under development), its primary strength lies in fast code transformation. It competes with esbuild in the fast build tool space and is increasingly being adopted by larger frameworks and build tools (like Next.js and Parcel) as a performance-enhancing replacement for parts of their build pipeline (e.g., replacing Babel for transpilation). Its market position is that of a foundational, high-speed layer for modern web build processes, prioritizing performance and extensibility."
