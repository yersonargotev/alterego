  "marketPositioning": "Prisma ORM, powered by prisma-engines, positions itself as a modern, developer-centric ORM for the TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem. It differentiates itself through a schema-first approach, strong end-to-end type safety, and a focus on developer experience with tools like Prisma Studio. While newer than established ORMs like TypeORM and Sequelize in the Node.js space, and ORMs in other languages like Hibernate and SQLAlchemy, Prisma targets developers building modern, data-driven applications, including those leveraging serverless architectures, by providing a streamlined and type-safe way to interact with databases."
