  "marketPositioning": "Ore is a digital currency designed for inclusive and accessible mining. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies where mining is dominated by specialized hardware and large pools, Ore utilizes a novel proof-of-work algorithm with non-exclusive rewards. This unique approach provides each miner with a personalized computational challenge, guaranteeing that any valid solution earns a portion of the supply and preventing miner starvation. The supply growth of Ore is strictly bounded and linear, with the mining reward rate dynamically adjusting to maintain predictability. Developed in Rust, Ore offers command-line tools and support for private mining pools, empowering individuals to participate in the network and obtain the currency from standard computing devices, challenging the centralization seen in other mineable cryptocurrencies."
