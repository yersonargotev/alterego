  "projectName": "zenoh",
  "projectPurpose": "To provide a unified, highly efficient, and flexible data communication and management layer for distributed systems, unifying data in motion, data in-use, and data at rest, particularly excelling in edge, IoT, and robotics environments.",
  "platforms": [
    "Cross-platform (supports various Rust targets, including those for constrained devices)"
  ],
  "mainFeatures": [
    "Unifies data in motion (pub/sub), data in-use (computations), and data at rest (storage/queries)",
    "Highly efficient: low latency, high throughput, minimal wire overhead",
    "Supports flexible communication topologies (peer-to-peer, routed, brokered)",
    "Data-centric approach with location transparency",
    "Designed for resource-constrained environments (IoT, Edge, Robotics)",
    "Includes a lightweight version for microcontrollers (zenoh-pico)"

  "marketPositioning": "Eclipse Zenoh positions itself as a highly efficient, next-generation protocol unifying data in motion, data at rest, and computations across the entire computing continuum, from microcontrollers to the cloud. Unlike traditional pub/sub (like MQTT) which is primarily data in motion and broker-dependent, or DDS which focuses on real-time data distribution in specific domains, or Kafka which is a high-throughput distributed log for data streaming often requiring more infrastructure, Zenoh offers a more integrated, flexible, and resource-efficient approach tailored for the challenges of edge computing, IoT, and robotics, supporting diverse topologies and providing built-in data storage and query capabilities."
