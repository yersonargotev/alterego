  "marketPositioning": "Graphite is an open-source 2D graphics editor that distinguishes itself by adopting a node-based, non-destructive, and procedural workflow for both vector and raster graphics. While traditional editors rely on layers, Graphite's core is built around a node graph, offering unparalleled flexibility and control over the design process, allowing for easy iteration and modification. This positions it as a modern, innovative alternative challenging the paradigms of established layer-based tools like Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, GIMP, and Inkscape, and more closely aligning its workflow with procedural tools found in 3D and VFX. It aims to be a versatile, all-in-one procedural toolbox for 2D content creation."
