  "marketPositioning": "cmd-wrapped is positioned as a dedicated analysis and visualization tool for existing shell history data. Unlike alternatives like Atuin that replace the history mechanism with advanced search and sync, cmd-wrapped focuses specifically on generating statistical summaries and visual reports (like year-end 'wrapped' stats and activity graphs) from various shell history sources. It serves as a reporting layer to help users understand their command-line usage patterns over time."
