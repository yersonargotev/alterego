1.  **Key Information Extraction:**
    *   Project Name: `cmd-wrapped`
    *   Description: "Find out what the past year looks like in command line!"
    *   Main Features:
        *   Analyzes command-line activity distribution for months, days, and hours.
        *   Provides a Github-style command distribution graph.
        *   Supports analyzing history from zsh, bash, fish, nushell, and atuin.
        *   A CLI tool written in Rust.

2.  **Project Purpose:**
    The project's purpose is to analyze a user's shell history and provide statistics and visualizations about their command-line activity over a specified period (specifically, the past year). This helps users understand their terminal usage patterns, such as the most active times and frequently used commands.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Alternative Tools:**
    Based on the purpose of analyzing command-line history and providing statistics, potential alternatives include:
    *   Tools that directly analyze shell history files (`.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`, etc.).
    *   Enhanced shell history tools that store history in a database and offer advanced querying/analysis features.
    *   General system monitoring tools that might include terminal activity as part of their metrics (though less focused on historical command analysis).
    *   Forensic tools that parse shell history for investigative purposes (often more complex than a user-focused analysis tool).
    *   Built-in shell commands for history management and basic analysis.

            *   Stores additional context (exit code, cwd, duration, etc.).
            *   Calculates statistics (like most used commands).
        *   Website URL: https://atuin.sh/

    *   **Built-in `history` command (Bash/Zsh):**

        *   Licensing: Open Source (as part of the shell, e.g., Bash, Zsh)
        *   Platforms: Linux, macOS, other Unix-like systems.
        *   Main Features:
            *   Displays a list of previously executed commands.
            *   Allows re-execution of commands by number.
            *   Basic filtering and searching (often via piping to `grep`).
            *   Configuration options for history size and format (e.g., `HISTTIMEFORMAT` for timestamps).
        *   Website URL: N/A (Part of the shell documentation)

    *   **`zsh-history-analysis`:**
        *   Name: zsh-history-analysis
        *   Licensing: Open Source (Check GitHub repo for specific license, typically MIT or similar for such projects)
        *   Platforms: Linux, macOS, other Unix-like systems (Requires Zsh and potentially Bash, Python, R).
        *   Main Features:
            *   Parses Zsh history files.
            *   Provides scripts for analysis and visualization (using Python and R).
            *   Can be extended to support Bash.
            *   Focuses on plotting and statistical analysis of history.
        *   Website URL: https://github.com/bamos/zsh-history-analysis

    *   **Clink (for Windows cmd.exe):**
        *   Name: Clink
        *   Licensing: Open Source (Check website/repo for specific license)
        *   Platforms: Windows (specifically cmd.exe and can work with PowerShell).
        *   Main Features:
            *   Enhances cmd.exe with Bash-style features.
            *   Saves command history persistently.
            *   Offers command completion and editing.
            *   Configurable history behavior.

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    The most well-known and widely used alternatives are the **built-in `history` commands** present in standard shells like Bash and Zsh, as they are available by default on virtually all Unix-like systems. Among third-party tools focused on enhanced history, **Atuin** appears to be gaining significant traction and is frequently mentioned as a modern replacement for shell history, offering sync and advanced search features.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    `cmd-wrapped` positions itself as a specialized *analysis and visualization* tool for shell history. While tools like Atuin replace the history mechanism itself and offer analysis as a feature, `cmd-wrapped` focuses purely on taking existing history files (from various shells and Atuin) and generating statistical reports and visual summaries (specifically mentioning a "Github-style command distribution graph"). Its key differentiators are its dedicated focus on year-end style statistics and visualizations of usage patterns across time (months, days, hours), rather than being a replacement for the history search or storage mechanism. It acts as a reporting layer on top of existing history data.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    `cmd-wrapped` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Rust designed to provide users with insights into their historical terminal usage. It analyzes command history from various popular shells including zsh, bash, fish, and nushell, as well as the enhanced history tool Atuin. The tool generates detailed statistics and a visualization, often described as a "Github-style command distribution graph," showing the distribution of command-line activity across different periods like months, weekdays, and hours. This allows users to get a "wrapped" summary of their past year's command-line habits, understanding when they were most active and potentially identifying frequently used commands. Unlike tools that replace the shell history mechanism, `cmd-wrapped` functions as a reporting and analysis layer on top of existing history files.
