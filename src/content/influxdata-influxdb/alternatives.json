  "marketPositioning": "InfluxDB is positioned as a purpose-built, high-performance, and scalable open-source time-series database. Its market strength lies in providing a dedicated solution for collecting, storing, and analyzing time-series data from sources like monitoring systems, IoT devices, and applications, emphasizing high ingestion rates and fast real-time query responses. While competing with broader monitoring tools like Prometheus and comprehensive observability platforms like Datadog, InfluxDB focuses specifically on optimizing the time-series data layer. Its support for multiple query languages, including recent adoption of SQL, broadens its appeal beyond users of its native languages, positioning it as a flexible alternative to both specialized time-series databases and general-purpose databases for time-series workloads."
