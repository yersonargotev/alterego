  "mostWellKnownAlternative": "Docker",
  "marketPositioning": "Cross positions itself as a specialized, 'zero setup' tool for Rust developers, uniquely combining the power of Rust's build system (Cargo/Rustup) with the isolation and reproducibility of containerization (Docker/Podman) to provide a streamlined experience for cross-compilation and, notably, cross-testing. While alternatives like Rustup/Cargo offer foundational cross-compilation capabilities, they often require manual setup of complex toolchains and dependencies. Buildroot is a broader embedded Linux build system. cargo-zigbuild focuses on simplifying linking but lacks the full environment provision and testing features. Cross fills the gap for Rust users needing an easy, reliable way to build and test for diverse targets without extensive host system configuration."
