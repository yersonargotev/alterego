  "marketPositioning": "Cloud Hypervisor is positioned as a modern, secure, and lightweight Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) specifically optimized for cloud-native workloads and containerization. It differentiates itself from general-purpose VMMs like QEMU by minimizing emulation and focusing on paravirtualized I/O for a smaller attack surface and improved performance. Compared to other lightweight cloud VMMs like Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor offers broader guest OS (Windows and Linux) and hypervisor (KVM and MSHV) compatibility. It targets users and platforms requiring secure, efficient, and scalable virtualization for contemporary applications in cloud and edge environments, often serving as a foundational component for secure container runtimes like Kata Containers, rather than being a full-fledged, user-facing virtualization platform like VirtualBox or enterprise solutions like VMware vSphere."
