  "marketPositioning": "Tera positions itself as a high-performance, easy-to-use template engine for Rust, leveraging the widely familiar syntax of Jinja2 and Django templates. It competes with other Rust template engines by offering a traditional file-based templating workflow while emphasizing speed and comprehensive features like inheritance, filtering, and automatic escaping. Its appeal lies in providing a comfortable transition for developers experienced with Python web frameworks and their templating systems, bringing that expressiveness and flexibility to the Rust ecosystem."
