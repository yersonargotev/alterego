  "marketPositioning": "AICI is positioned as a foundational, low-level interface for controlling LLM decoding at the token generation level. Its core innovation is the use of WebAssembly (Wasm) modules running directly alongside the LLM inference engine, offering a performant, secure, and portable way to implement real-time control logic. Unlike higher-level frameworks that focus on orchestrating multi-step workflows or data integration, AICI provides a mechanism to directly influence the LLM's output generation process itself. It serves as a layer upon which more specialized control libraries can be built, offering efficiency and portability across different LLM serving backends."
