  "marketPositioning": "NativeLink is positioned as a high-performance, open-source implementation of the Bazel Remote Execution API. It competes with other open-source alternatives like Buildbarn and Buildfarm by emphasizing performance and Rust-based implementation. Compared to commercial services such as BuildBuddy and EngFlow, NativeLink offers the control and transparency of open source, appealing to organizations preferring self-hosted solutions. Its focus on speed and support for specialized hardware caters to users with demanding build workloads and specific infrastructure needs within the RBE-compatible build system ecosystem."
