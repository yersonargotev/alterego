  "marketPositioning": "ord is positioned as the foundational, technical, command-line interface for the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol. Unlike more user-friendly wallets or marketplaces that abstract away the complexity, ord provides direct access to indexing, block exploration, and wallet operations for satoshis and inscriptions. It is a core piece of infrastructure for the Ordinals ecosystem, primarily targeting developers, researchers, and power users who require granular control and a deep understanding of the protocol, serving as the base layer upon which many other higher-level Ordinals tools and platforms are built."
