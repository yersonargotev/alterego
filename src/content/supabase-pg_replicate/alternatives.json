  "marketPositioning": "pg_replicate is a specialized open-source Rust library for developers seeking to build high-performance, custom applications that consume PostgreSQL logical replication streams. Unlike broader CDC platforms like Debezium (which provide an end-to-end solution often integrated with Kafka) or database-level replication tools like pglogical, pg_replicate focuses specifically on providing the foundational components in Rust to read and process real-time data changes from PostgreSQL's logical decoding feature. This positions it as a tool for developers who require fine-grained control over their CDC pipeline or data integration logic and prefer to work within the Rust ecosystem."
