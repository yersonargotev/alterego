  "marketPositioning": "Tantivy is positioned as a high-performance, Rust-native full-text search *library*, serving as a direct alternative to Apache Lucene for developers who require an embeddable search engine or wish to build custom search solutions. Unlike full-fledged search servers like Elasticsearch and Apache Solr, which offer distributed capabilities and a complete server stack, Tantivy focuses on providing the core indexing and searching primitives with a strong emphasis on speed, low-level control, and the benefits of the Rust programming language. This makes it suitable for applications where embedding the search functionality is preferred or where a custom search server needs to be built from the ground up, leveraging Rust's performance and safety features."
