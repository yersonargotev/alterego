  "marketPositioning": "Madara is an official, open-source implementation of the SN Stack, designed as a highly modular ZK Rollup framework for building customizable appchains. It leverages Starknet's core technologies, including the Cairo VM and STARK proofs, providing a powerful engine for creating provable programs and scalable infrastructure. Built on the Substrate framework, Madara offers exceptional modularity and flexibility, allowing developers to configure key components such as consensus mechanisms, data availability layers, and execution environments. Madara enables the deployment of appchains that can settle to either Ethereum or Starknet, facilitating Layer 2 and Layer 3 scaling solutions. Its open-source nature encourages customization and community contributions, positioning it as a leading choice for developers seeking to build application-specific blockchains deeply integrated with or extending the Starknet ecosystem, while also offering potential interoperability with other Substrate-based chains. Madara is recognized as a high-performance Starknet sequencer, optimized for developer experience and supporting the full range of Starknet JSON-RPC methods alongside its own custom extensions."
