  "marketPositioning": "Just is a command runner, not a build system, designed to help you save and run project-specific commands efficiently across Linux, macOS, and Windows. It uses a simple justfile with a syntax inspired by make but avoids much of make's complexity and idiosyncrasies, making it easier to define and manage common development tasks. Recipes (commands) can accept arguments, load environment variables from .env files, and be written in any language. just provides specific and informative error messages, performs static checks for errors like unknown recipes or circular dependencies before execution, and can be invoked from any subdirectory of your project. Features like command line completion, recipe listing, aliases, and fuzzy searching enhance the developer experience, making just a convenient and powerful tool for automating project workflows."
