  "marketPositioning": "Amber positions itself as a modern, type-safe, and developer-friendly alternative for writing Bash scripts. Its core value proposition is compiling to pure Bash, ensuring high portability without external runtime dependencies. This makes it ideal for environments where traditional scripting languages are not easily deployable. By offering a familiar syntax (ECMA script-like) and built-in safety features like type and runtime checking, Amber aims to make shell scripting less error-prone and more enjoyable compared to writing directly in Bash. While general-purpose languages like Python offer broader capabilities, Amber focuses on improving the fundamental experience of shell scripting itself, targeting users who need Bash's ubiquity but desire a more robust development experience."
