  "marketPositioning": "Wasmtime is positioned as a leading, secure, and standards-driven WebAssembly runtime for server-side and edge environments. It differentiates itself through its strong emphasis on security and correctness, leveraging Rust's safety features and rigorous testing. Built on the Cranelift optimizing compiler, it offers high performance through both JIT and AOT compilation. As a core project of the Bytecode Alliance, Wasmtime is at the forefront of implementing WASI and the Component Model, promoting open standards and interoperability. It serves as a robust, embeddable, and configurable alternative to browser-based runtimes and heavier container solutions, particularly for use cases requiring safe and efficient execution of untrusted code outside the web."
