  "marketPositioning": "neverest is positioned as a specialized, open-source command-line interface (CLI) tool for email synchronization, backup, and restoration. Its primary market appeal is to technical users, developers, and system administrators who prefer or require automation, scripting, and terminal-based workflows for managing their email data. Unlike many mainstream GUI-based email clients or commercial backup software, neverest focuses on providing core sync, backup, and restore functionalities via a command line, built with a modern language (Rust) for potential performance and reliability advantages. This differentiates it from migration-focused tools like imapsync or platform-specific tools like GYB, offering a more general-purpose CLI solution for email archiving and management."
