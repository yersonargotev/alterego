  "marketPositioning": "Niri is positioned as a unique Wayland compositor within the tiling window manager space. Its core differentiator is the scrollable-tiling layout, offering an infinite horizontal workspace that prevents windows from resizing when new ones are opened. This provides an alternative workflow compared to traditional static or dynamic tiling window managers like Sway and Hyprland. By being a native Wayland compositor, it aims to avoid limitations faced by implementations built on top of other display servers. While not a full desktop environment, it offers a range of modern features such as dynamic workspaces, built-in screencasting, and extensive visual customization, targeting users who prioritize this distinct scrollable paradigm on Wayland."
