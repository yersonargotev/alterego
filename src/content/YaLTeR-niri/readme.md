        *   Touchpad and mouse gestures.
        *   Group windows into tabs.
        *   Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes.
        *   Gradient borders with Oklab and Oklch support.
        *   Animations with support for custom shaders.
        *   Live-reloading config.
        *   Multi-monitor support.

        *   Floating windows support.
        *   Input device support (tablets, touchpads, touchscreens).
        *   VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) support.
        *   IPC improvements.

2.  **Project Purpose:**

    Based on the description and features, the project's purpose is to provide a unique and modern window management experience on Linux using the Wayland display protocol. It focuses on a "scrollable-tiling" layout as its core paradigm, differentiating itself from traditional tiling window managers. It aims to be a stable and feature-rich Wayland compositor for users who prefer this specific workflow.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Alternative Tools:**

    The core function is a Wayland compositor with a specific window management style (tiling). Alternatives would include other Wayland compositors, particularly those that offer tiling or similar window management approaches. Window managers for the older X11 system could also be considered, although they operate on a different display protocol.

    *   Other Wayland compositors (tiling, dynamic, stacking)
    *   X11 tiling window managers
    *   Desktop Environments (which include compositors)

4.  **Research and List Alternative Tools:**

    *   **Sway:** A tiling Wayland compositor that is a drop-in replacement for the i3 window manager.
    *   **Hyprland:** A highly customizable, dynamic tiling Wayland compositor known for its aesthetics and features.
    *   **KWin:** The default window manager and Wayland compositor for KDE Plasma. It supports tiling, stacking, and floating layouts.
    *   **i3:** A popular tiling window manager for the X11 window system.

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative Overall:**

    Considering both Wayland and X11, and including full desktop environments, **KWin** (as part of KDE Plasma) is likely the most widely used alternative due to the popularity of the KDE Plasma desktop environment. Among dedicated tiling window managers/compositors, **Sway** (Wayland) and **i3** (X11) are very well-known and widely used.

6.  **Market Positioning:**

    Niri positions itself as a "scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor." Its key differentiator is the scrollable tiling layout, where windows are arranged in columns on an infinite horizontal strip, and opening new windows doesn't resize existing ones. This is distinct from the more common static or dynamic tiling found in alternatives like Sway and Hyprland, where windows typically resize to fill the available space within a fixed area or container. While inspired by PaperWM, Niri is a native Wayland compositor, addressing limitations of extensions running on top of other compositors. It also offers features like dynamic workspaces, built-in screenshot/screencasting, and extensive configuration options, positioning it as a feature-rich option within the niche of tiling Wayland compositors, specifically targeting users who prefer or are interested in the scrollable layout paradigm. Compared to full desktop environments like KDE Plasma (using KWin), Niri is a more minimal compositor, requiring additional components like a status bar and application launcher.

7.  **Expanded Description:**

    Niri is a Wayland compositor built from the ground up for a unique "scrollable-tiling" window management experience. Unlike traditional tiling window managers where windows resize to fit the screen, niri arranges windows in columns on an infinite horizontal strip, allowing users to scroll between them. Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize. Each monitor has its own independent window strip. It also supports dynamic workspaces, built-in screenshot and screencasting capabilities, touchpad and mouse gestures, window tab grouping, and extensive configuration options including gradient borders and animations. While stable for daily use, niri is not a complete desktop environment and requires additional components like a status bar and application launcher.
