  "marketPositioning": "Floneum positions itself as a privacy-focused, controllable AI toolkit designed for consumer hardware. While sharing the local execution and privacy benefits with alternatives like Ollama and LM Studio, Floneum emphasizes the 'toolkit' aspect, suggesting a potentially more modular or controllable environment compared to the more common chatbot interfaces. Its implementation in Rust also targets developers seeking performance and reliability. It differentiates from API-focused tools like LocalAI by likely offering a more direct user interaction method, while being more general-purpose than creative-writing focused tools like KoboldAI."
