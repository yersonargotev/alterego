  "marketPositioning": "Mira Screenshare (Sharer) is positioned as a high-performance, open-source, and easy-to-use screen sharing and remote collaboration tool. It differentiates itself from more general remote desktop software by focusing on low-latency, high-resolution screen streaming built with modern technologies (Rust, WebRTC). Its primary use case appears to be collaborative scenarios like pair programming and troubleshooting, emphasized by features like concurrent viewer support and a no-setup browser-based viewer. This focus, combined with its open-source nature, positions it as a performant, customizable alternative to larger, often proprietary, remote support and meeting tools, particularly for users who prioritize performance and control over extensive feature sets like unattended access or mobile device management."
