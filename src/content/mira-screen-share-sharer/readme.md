5.  **Identify the most well-known or widely used alternative overall:**
    Based on market presence, general public recognition, and widespread use for both personal and commercial purposes, **TeamViewer** and **AnyDesk** are among the most well-known proprietary remote desktop/screen sharing tools.. Zoom is extremely widely used for meetings which often include screen sharing.

6.  **Analyze the market positioning:**
    "Sharer" (Mira Screenshare) positions itself as a high-performance, open-source alternative focusing specifically on screen sharing and remote collaboration, built with Rust and WebRTC. Its key differentiators appear to be the emphasis on performance (low latency, high resolution), the modern tech stack (Rust, WebRTC), and the ease of access for viewers (web browser). While many alternatives offer remote control and screen sharing, "sharer"'s focus seems to be on providing a streamlined, high-quality screen *sharing* experience primarily for collaboration scenarios like pair programming or troubleshooting, rather than full-fledged remote IT support or unattended access like TeamViewer, AnyDesk, or RustDesk. The concurrent viewer support is also a notable feature for collaborative use cases. Its open-source nature also positions it against the dominant proprietary players like TeamViewer and AnyDesk.

7.  **Provide an expanded description:**
    Mira Screenshare (Sharer) is an open-source screen sharing and remote collaboration software built with Rust and WebRTC. It prioritizes high-performance screen capturing and streaming, aiming for low latency and high resolutions (up to 4K at 60 FPS with low E2E latency under optimal conditions). Designed for scenarios like remote pair programming and troubleshooting, it offers remote mouse and keyboard control and supports concurrent viewers. A notable feature is the ease of access for viewers, who can join sessions via a web browser without requiring any setup. The project is free, open-source, and available for macOS and Windows, leveraging secure peer-to-peer connections. Users also have the option to host their own servers for greater control.
