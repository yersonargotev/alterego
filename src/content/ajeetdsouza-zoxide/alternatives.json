  "marketPositioning": "zoxide is positioned as a modern, fast, and user-friendly replacement for the standard `cd` command. Building upon the concepts of earlier directory jump tools like `autojump` and `z`, zoxide differentiates itself through its superior performance (written in Rust), broad shell compatibility, and a focus on a minimal, ergonomic interface. It targets users who want to streamline their command-line workflow and navigate their filesystem more efficiently by leveraging learned habits and providing quick jumping and interactive selection capabilities."
