It offers a faster, project-centric approach with integrated lock files and a modern CLI, differentiating itself from traditional Conda and Python-specific tools like Pip/venv, Poetry, and Pipenv by its multi-language support via Conda and its performance gains from being written in Rust. It aims to unify package management across different languages and ecosystems."
