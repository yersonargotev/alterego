  "marketPositioning": "Lemmy is positioned as a decentralized, open-source, and community-driven alternative to large, centralized social platforms like Reddit. Its key differentiator is its integration with the Fediverse via ActivityPub, enabling users across independent instances to interact seamlessly. By being self-hostable and licensed under the AGPL, it emphasizes user control, privacy, and freedom from corporate advertising, tracking, and algorithmic manipulation, standing in contrast to proprietary platforms and offering a federated model distinct from traditional standalone forum software."
