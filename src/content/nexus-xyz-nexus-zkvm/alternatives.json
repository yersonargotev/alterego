  "marketPositioning": "The Nexus zkVM positions itself as a high-performance, modular, and extensible general-purpose zero-knowledge virtual machine, focusing on proving *any* computation efficiently through features like parallelization, incremental verification, and advanced proof systems. While other notable zkVMs often focus on specific ecosystems (like zkEVMs for Ethereum compatibility) or particular architectures (like RISC-V), Nexus emphasizes its own NVM architecture and its ambition to be a foundational technology for a verifiable internet beyond just blockchain scaling, aiming for massive compute capacity."
