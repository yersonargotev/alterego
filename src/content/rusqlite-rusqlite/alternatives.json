  "marketPositioning": "Rusqlite is positioned as a direct, ergonomic, and feature-rich binding to the SQLite C library for Rust. Unlike ORMs (Diesel, SeaORM, OrmLite, MicrORM) that provide higher-level abstractions or multi-database clients (SQLx) with async focus and compile-time raw SQL checks, rusqlite offers a safe and idiomatic Rust interface that stays close to SQLite's core functionality, making it ideal for applications specifically requiring direct SQLite interaction with Rust's safety and performance benefits. LibSQL is a more fundamental alternative as a complete rewrite of SQLite in Rust."
