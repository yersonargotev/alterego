  "marketPositioning": "GreptimeDB is positioned as a unified, cloud-native, and high-performance observability database that converges metrics, logs, and traces into a single system. It differentiates itself from traditional approaches that rely on separate databases for each data type (e.g., Prometheus for metrics, Elasticsearch for logs) by offering a simplified architecture, unified query languages (SQL and PromQL), and a focus on performance at scale using Rust and columnar storage with object storage integration. Its open-source Apache 2.0 license provides a distinct advantage over some alternatives with more restrictive licensing models. It competes with specialized time-series databases, analytical databases used for observability, and other unified observability backends, aiming to provide a more efficient and cost-effective solution for modern distributed systems."
