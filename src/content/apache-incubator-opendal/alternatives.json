  "marketPositioning": "Apache OpenDAL positions itself as a universal data access layer built with a solid foundation in Rust for performance and safety. Unlike cloud-specific SDKs or migration tools like rclone, OpenDAL provides a single, unified API for applications to interact with a diverse range of storage services, emphasizing an \"Object Storage First\" approach. Its extensible and actively developed nature differentiates it from some older Java-based abstraction libraries, targeting modern cloud-native applications requiring portable and efficient data access."
