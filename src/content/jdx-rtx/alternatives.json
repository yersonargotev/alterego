  "marketPositioning": "mise (formerly rtx) is positioned as a faster, more user-friendly, and unified alternative to existing polyglot version managers like asdf and environment variable managers like direnv. It aims to provide a single tool for managing language versions, environment variables, and tasks, addressing performance and usability issues found in some alternatives while maintaining compatibility with established ecosystems like asdf plugins. Its Rust implementation is a key differentiator for performance."
