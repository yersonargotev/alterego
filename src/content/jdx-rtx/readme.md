    *   Environment Variable Managers: direnv, dotenv.
    *   Task Runners: Just, Task, Make, npm scripts, yarn scripts, Invoke, Grunt, Gulp, Bazel, Please.
    *   Tools combining aspects of these: Nix, Conda.

4.  **Research and List Alternative Tools:**

    *   **asdf:**
        *   Name: asdf
        *   Licensing: MIT License
        *   Supported Platforms: macOS, Linux (Unix-like systems).
        *   Main Features: Extendable version manager for multiple languages via plugins, consistent CLI, `.tool-versions` config file, automatically switches versions by directory, supports existing config files (e.g., `.nvmrc`).

    *   **direnv:**
        *   Name: direnv
        *   Licensing: MIT License (based on common usage, though some sources mention Public Domain/Unlicense for a Python implementation). The official website and GitHub suggest MIT.
        *   Supported Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows (via integrations like with Git Bash or Cygwin, or potentially WSL). Primarily targets Unix-like shells.
        *   Main Features: Loads and unloads environment variables based on the current directory, integrates with various shells, can be used to manage project-specific settings and secrets.

    *   **Just:**
        *   Name: Just
        *   Licensing: CC0 (Public Domain)
        *   Supported Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, and other Unix-like systems.
        *   Main Features: Command runner for project-specific recipes, simpler than Make, supports variables and arguments, loads .env files, command line completion.

    *   **Task:**
        *   Name: Task
        *   Licensing: MIT License (Common for Go projects, likely MIT but needs verification)
        *   Supported Platforms: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows).
        *   Main Features: Task runner/build tool, single binary with no dependencies, easy installation, works well on CIs, good for code generation based on file changes.

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Among the direct competitors that combine version management and environment handling, **asdf** is likely the most well-known and widely used, having been established for longer and supporting a vast plugin ecosystem. However, for environment variable management specifically, **direnv** is also very widely used. For task running, **npm scripts** (part of Node.js) and traditional **Make** are extremely common, but among dedicated task runners, **Just** and **Task** are gaining popularity. Considering the combination of features, **asdf** stands out as the most direct and well-established multi-language version manager that `rtx` aims to improve upon.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    rtx positions itself as a modern, faster, and more user-friendly alternative to existing developer tools, particularly **asdf** and **direnv**. While asdf is a popular multi-language version manager, rtx aims to solve some of its perceived shortcomings, such as performance issues and the use of shims. By integrating environment variable management (like direnv) and basic task running capabilities, rtx offers a more unified solution compared to using separate tools for each purpose. Its implementation in Rust is highlighted for performance benefits. The project's compatibility with asdf plugins smooths the transition for existing asdf users. Its market positioning is that of an "asdf killer" or a "next-generation" tool for managing polyglot development environments efficiently and elegantly. The recent renaming to `mise` also suggests a move towards a broader identity beyond just an "asdf clone."

7.  **Expanded Description of the Given Tool:**
    rtx, now officially known as mise, is a polyglot version manager, environment variable manager, and task runner built in Rust. It is designed to be a fast and user-friendly tool for managing development environments across different projects. rtx is highly compatible with asdf's plugin ecosystem and `.tool-versions` configuration files, making it a potential drop-in replacement for asdf users. Key advantages highlighted include significantly faster performance compared to asdf, a simpler user experience, the elimination of shims (addressing issues like `which` command behavior), built-in support for managing arbitrary environment variables (reducing the need for tools like direnv or dotenv), and integrated task running capabilities. rtx aims to provide a single, efficient command-line interface for handling project dependencies, environment configuration, and common development tasks, streamlining the developer workflow, particularly in projects using multiple programming languages or tools.
