  "marketPositioning": "Webx is positioned as a radical, ground-up alternative to the existing World Wide Web stack. Unlike projects that enhance the current web (e.g., new browsers, search engines) or focus on specific aspects like decentralization of existing content (IPFS), anonymity (Freenet), or simplicity (Gemini), webx aims to build a completely parallel ecosystem with its own protocol ('buss://'), custom browser, custom rendering engine, and search engine, supporting rich content using HTML, CSS, and Lua. Its market is potentially composed of individuals or communities seeking a fundamentally different technical foundation for web-like communication and content."
