  "marketPositioning": "Youki is positioned as a modern, low-level container runtime that implements the OCI specification, offering potential advantages in memory safety and performance by being written in Rust. It directly competes with other OCI runtimes like runc and crun and aims to be a drop-in replacement usable by higher-level container tools and orchestration platforms, with a focus on compatibility and integration within the broader container ecosystem, particularly for Linux environments."
