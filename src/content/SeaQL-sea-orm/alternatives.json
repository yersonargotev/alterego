  "mainFeatures": [
    "Async-friendly database operations",
    "Dynamic query building via SeaQuery integration",
    "Testable with mock connections and SQLite",
    "Service-oriented features for building APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)",

  "marketPositioning": "SeaORM positions itself as a modern, async-first, and dynamic ORM for Rust web service development. Leveraging SQLx for async capabilities and SeaQuery for flexible query building, it offers a higher-level ORM abstraction compared to SQLx's query builder approach and is async-native unlike the core Diesel library. Its feature set, including a CLI and complementary tools like Seaography and SeaORM Pro, targets developers seeking a comprehensive solution for building data-driven APIs in Rust with a development flow that may feel more familiar to users of ORMs in dynamic languages. It competes directly with Diesel as a primary Rust ORM alternative, emphasizing async support and dynamic query flexibility as key differentiators."
