    *   Tools that handle specific LaTeX file types like BibTeX.

4.  **Research and List Alternative Tools:**

    *   **latexindent:**
        *   Name: latexindent
        *   Licensing: Open Source (Perl script)
        *   Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux (requires Perl or available as executables)
        *   Main Features: Highly configurable via YAML interface, modifies line breaks, text wrapping, string/regex substitutions, indentation for environments and commands.

    *   **TeXstudio:**
        *   Name: TeXstudio
        *   Licensing: Open Source (GPL)
        *   Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux
        *   Main Features: Integrated writing environment, syntax highlighting, integrated viewer, reference checking, assistants for tables/formulas/images, auto-completion, includes a formatter (often uses latexindent or has its own basic indentation).
        *   Website: https://www.texstudio.org/

    *   **Overleaf (Community Edition):**
        *   Name: Overleaf (Community Edition)
        *   Licensing: Open Source (GNU AGPLv3)
        *   Platforms: Web (self-hostable)
        *   Main Features: Collaborative online editor, real-time preview, version history, supports inserting various elements, based on ShareLaTeX editor, LaTeX environment included.
        *   Website: https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf (for Community Edition) or https://www.overleaf.com (hosted version)

    *   **texpretty:**
        *   Name: texpretty
        *   Licensing: Open Source (based on search results, often mentioned in the context of other open-source formatters)
        *   Platforms: Command-line tool (originally C, availability may vary)
        *   Main Features: C program, sometimes works and appears fast, handles indentation. (Note: Less actively maintained/referenced compared to latexindent or tex-fmt).
        *   Website: Difficult to find an official dedicated website; often referenced in forums or older lists.

    *   **latex-formatter (VS Code extension):**
        *   Name: latex-formatter (VS Code extension)
        *   Licensing: Open Source (typically MIT for VS Code extensions)
        *   Platforms: Requires VS Code (Windows, macOS, Linux)
        *   Main Features: Integrates LaTeX formatting into VS Code, often uses a backend like latexindent.
        *   Website: VS Code Marketplace page (specific URL may vary by marketplace).

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on search results and community discussions, **latexindent** appears to be the most well-known and widely used dedicated command-line LaTeX formatter. **TeXstudio** is a very popular LaTeX editor that often includes formatting features, sometimes relying on latexindent. **Overleaf** is a very popular *online editor* that includes formatting, but it's a full IDE, not just a formatter. Considering dedicated formatters, latexindent is likely the most prevalent.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    `tex-fmt` positions itself primarily on **speed** ("extremely fast") and **simplicity** ("minimal configuration required" / "no configuration necessary"). It explicitly contrasts itself with `latexindent`, which is described as "slow on large files" but having "many configuration options". `tex-fmt` targets users who prioritize fast, automated formatting with little need for deep customization. Its Rust implementation suggests a focus on performance and memory safety. While other tools like integrated editor formatters exist, `tex-fmt` provides a dedicated, fast, command-line utility for build pipelines or scripting, which is a niche where its speed is a key advantage.

7.  **Expanded Description of tex-fmt:**
    `tex-fmt` is an extremely fast command-line LaTeX formatter written in Rust. Designed for developers and users who need quick and automated formatting of their LaTeX source files, it handles `.tex`, `.bib`, `.cls`, and `.sty` file types. Unlike some other formatters that offer extensive configuration, `tex-fmt` aims for minimal setup, making it easy to integrate into workflows, build processes, or use for quick cleanup of LaTeX code. Its core strength lies in its performance, providing significantly faster formatting compared to established tools like `latexindent`, especially on larger documents. It offers basic control such as checking formatting without modifying files, printing to standard output, and preventing line wrapping, along with options to ignore specific lines or blocks of code. A GitHub Action is also available for automated formatting in CI/CD pipelines.
