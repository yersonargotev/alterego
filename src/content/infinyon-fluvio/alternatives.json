  "marketPositioning": "Fluvio positions itself as a modern, high-performance, and developer-centric distributed event streaming platform. It stands out by being built in Rust, emphasizing efficiency, low resource consumption, and suitability for both cloud-native and edge deployments. Unlike traditional JVM-based systems like Kafka, Fluvio offers a smaller footprint and aims for simpler operations. Its integrated WebAssembly-based programmability (SmartModules) and Stateful DataFlow capabilities provide unique differentiators for in-stream processing and building complex real-time data pipelines, particularly relevant for emerging AI and IoT use cases at the edge. It competes directly with other high-performance alternatives like Redpanda but differentiates itself through its Rust/WASM architecture and specific focus on edge and AI applications."
