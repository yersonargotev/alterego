  "marketPositioning": "LACT positions itself as a comprehensive, vendor-agnostic GUI tool for advanced GPU configuration and monitoring on Linux. While vendor-specific tools exist (NVIDIA, AMD) and offer proprietary features, and other open-source tools focus primarily on monitoring (nvtop, intel_gpu_top, RadeonTop) or include CPU controls (CoreCtrl), LACT differentiates itself by providing a unified graphical interface with extensive control options (overclocking, fan curves, power states) across AMD, Nvidia, and Intel GPUs. It aims to fill the gap for Linux users seeking a single, powerful GUI application for managing their graphics card's performance and thermals, comparable to the control offered by proprietary software on other operating systems."
