  "marketPositioning": "VIPORMiner is positioned as a high-performance, stable, and easy-to-use multi-currency mining proxy and relay, emphasizing its broad altcoin support, high concurrency handling, minimal and threshold-free developer fee, and 'almost lossless' efficiency. It targets miners and farms needing a robust intermediary that can handle diverse operations efficiently with a simple setup, differentiating itself from more general mining software or proxies with its specific blend of performance features, coin support, and a distinct fee structure.",
  "expandedDescription": "VIPORMiner is a high-performance, multi-currency mining proxy and relay built with a focus on stability and efficiency. Designed to act as a robust intermediary between mining hardware and mining pools, it facilitates the mining of various cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, RVN, ERGO, CFX, KAS, IRON, CKB, KDA, ZEC, and NEXA. The project highlights its 'almost lossless forwarding' and 'almost abnormal precise ratio' for accurate share reporting. It boasts the capability to easily support millions of concurrent connections, making it suitable for large-scale mining operations. VIPORMiner features a fixed, low developer fee of 0.02%, uniquely applied without a minimum threshold on the number of mining machines. The tool is engineered for high performance, having passed 1000G pressure tests, and offers a simple one-click installation process for ease of use. Written in Rust, it aims for speed and reliability, positioning itself as a powerful and user-friendly solution for miners seeking an optimized and versatile proxy for diverse mining activities."
