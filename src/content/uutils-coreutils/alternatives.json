  "marketPositioning": "uutils/coreutils positions itself as a modern, safe, and cross-platform alternative to the ubiquitous GNU coreutils. Its key selling points are the enhanced memory safety provided by Rust and broad compatibility across operating systems, including Windows, which is not a primary target for GNU coreutils. While BSD coreutils offer an alternative, uutils/coreutils is a focused rewrite aiming for direct functional parity with GNU. Unlike BusyBox, which targets embedded systems with a minimal footprint, uutils/coreutils focuses on providing a full-featured, safe, and consistent command-line experience for general-purpose computing across diverse platforms. It aims to directly compete with and potentially replace the established GNU coreutils in various environments."
