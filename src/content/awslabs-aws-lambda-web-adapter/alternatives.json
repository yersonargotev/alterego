  "marketPositioning": "The AWS Lambda Web Adapter is positioned as a generic, language-agnostic solution for easily running traditional HTTP-serving web applications on AWS Lambda with minimal code changes. It targets developers and organizations who want to leverage Lambda's serverless benefits for existing web workloads without a full rewrite or deep immersion into Lambda's native event model. It sits between traditional server/container hosting and native Lambda function development, offering a simplified 'lift and shift' path compared to general serverless frameworks or language-specific adapters."
