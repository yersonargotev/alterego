  "marketPositioning": "HVM is positioned as a cutting-edge, research-driven runtime aiming to redefine the performance and parallelism achievable for functional programs. By implementing an optimal (beta-optimal) reduction strategy based on Interaction Nets and utilizing Rust for efficiency and a non-garbage-collected model, it seeks to surpass the performance of established functional runtimes like GHC and BEAM in specific, highly parallelizable functional computations. It serves as a low-level target for future high-performance functional languages and distinguishes itself from general-purpose runtimes like JVM and CLR by its specialized focus on optimal functional execution and massive parallelism."
