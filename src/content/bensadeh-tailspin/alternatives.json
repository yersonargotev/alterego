  "marketPositioning": "tailspin is positioned as a user-friendly, zero-configuration-by-default terminal log file highlighter. It offers immediate, intelligent highlighting of common log patterns, striking a balance between the basic functionality of core Unix tools like 'less' and 'grep' and the more advanced, often configuration-heavy features of dedicated log viewers like 'lnav' or 'ccze'. Its ease of use, integration with 'less', and focus on out-of-the-box highlighting make it accessible for users who need quick, enhanced log readability without deep customization initially, while still offering configuration options for advanced users."
