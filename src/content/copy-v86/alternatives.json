  "marketPositioning": "v86 is positioned as a highly accessible and portable x86 PC emulator that uniquely runs directly within a web browser. Unlike traditional desktop-based virtualization software (like VirtualBox, VMware, and QEMU) that require installation, or other browser emulators focused on older console hardware, v86 provides full x86 PC emulation capable of booting operating systems, leveraging WebAssembly for improved performance. This makes it ideal for quick access, educational purposes, and web-based demonstrations of legacy x86 environments, offering a distinct advantage in ease of use and accessibility directly through a web link."
