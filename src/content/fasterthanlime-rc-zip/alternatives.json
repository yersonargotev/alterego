  "marketPositioning": "rc-zip is positioned as a focused, pure Rust library specifically for reading ZIP and ZIP64 archives. Unlike broader archiving tools or libraries that offer both reading and writing, or those that wrap C libraries, rc-zip emphasizes a native Rust implementation for the reading task. This pure-Rust approach may appeal to developers prioritizing code safety, control, or specific performance characteristics within the Rust ecosystem for large ZIP file consumption, rather than general-purpose archiving or creation."
