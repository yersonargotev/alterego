  "mostWellKnownAlternative": "Apache Kafka",
  "marketPositioning": "Apache Iggy is positioned as a high-performance, resource-efficient, and flexible open-source message streaming platform built in Rust. It differentiates itself by offering superior performance characteristics and predictable resource usage compared to JVM-based alternatives like Kafka and Pulsar, while also supporting modern protocols like QUIC. By being built from scratch and emphasizing a simple architecture, it aims to provide an efficient solution for real-time data processing and event-driven systems, directly competing with established players in the streaming and message queuing market based on its technical merits."
