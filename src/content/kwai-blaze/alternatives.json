  "marketPositioning": "Blaze is positioned as a high-performance, open-source query execution engine that offers compatibility with the Apache Spark language. It differentiates itself by utilizing a modern architecture built on Apache Arrow and DataFusion, implemented in Rust, to achieve superior speed. While Apache Spark is a broader data processing framework, Blaze focuses specifically on optimizing the query execution layer. Compared to other distributed SQL engines like Trino/Presto, Blaze's unique selling proposition lies in its Spark language compatibility and its Rust/Arrow/DataFusion core. It competes with proprietary engines like Databricks Photon, which also accelerate Spark workloads, but offers an open-source alternative with a distinct technical foundation."
