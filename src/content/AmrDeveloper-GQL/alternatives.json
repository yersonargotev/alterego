  "marketPositioning": "GQL is positioned as a lightweight, developer-friendly tool that allows users to perform ad-hoc queries and analysis on Git repository data using a familiar SQL syntax, without the overhead of setting up a separate database. It competes with native Git commands by offering a more structured querying approach and with other SQL-on-Git tools by providing direct, on-the-fly execution."
