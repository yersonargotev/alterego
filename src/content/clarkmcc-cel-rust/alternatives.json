  "marketPositioning": "cel-rust is positioned as a high-performance, safe, and embeddable implementation of the Common Expression Language specifically tailored for the Rust ecosystem. It competes directly with other language implementations of CEL (Go, Java, C++) by offering the advantages of Rust, such as memory safety and suitability for low-level integration or WebAssembly targets. Unlike broader Business Rule Management Systems, cel-rust provides a focused expression evaluation capability, emphasizing speed and safety for use cases like policy enforcement and validation within performance-critical applications."
