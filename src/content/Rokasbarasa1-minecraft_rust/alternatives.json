  "marketPositioning": "minecraft_rust is an open-source project written in Rust, serving as a personal challenge by the author to create a simplified remake of the popular sandbox game Minecraft. It focuses on implementing the fundamental aspects of a voxel-based world, providing a basic foundation for mining, crafting, and building mechanics within the Rust programming language environment. This project is primarily a demonstration of Rust's capabilities in game development and the author's skills in building such systems from the ground up, rather than a feature-rich game or a general-purpose game engine aimed at broad usage. It is a niche contribution to the Rust and game development communities, valuable for educational purposes and as a starting point for those interested in voxel technology implementation in Rust."
