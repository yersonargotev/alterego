  "marketPositioning": "oha is positioned as a modern, visually appealing command-line HTTP load generator. It fills a niche for users who desire the speed and efficiency of a compiled language like Rust combined with the convenience of a CLI tool, but also value real-time visual feedback during testing provided by its unique TUI. While simpler than full-featured platforms like JMeter or k6, its strength lies in offering a more engaging and informative experience than minimalist tools like 'ab' or its direct inspiration, 'hey', for focused HTTP load testing from the terminal."
