  "marketPositioning": "Mullvad VPN Client App is positioned as a highly privacy-focused and transparent VPN client. Its open-source nature and support for anonymous account creation and payments distinguish it from many commercial VPNs that require personal information. While offering standard features like WireGuard and OpenVPN support, kill switch, and split tunneling, its emphasis is strongly on user anonymity and audited security rather than maximizing server count or unblocking streaming services (though it may work for some). It appeals to users who prioritize a high degree of privacy, transparency through open-source code, and alternative payment methods for enhanced anonymity."
