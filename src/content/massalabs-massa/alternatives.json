  "marketPositioning": "Massa positions itself as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain specifically designed to solve the blockchain trilemma by offering a unique combination of parallel block processing and transaction sharding for scalability, coupled with a focus on true decentralization and security via its Proof-of-Stake mechanism and high Nakamoto coefficient. Its key differentiators are its Autonomous Smart Contracts (ASCs), which enable self-triggering, decentralized automation, and its on-chain web hosting (DeWeb), providing a fully decentralized platform for dApps and websites, aiming to eliminate reliance on centralized infrastructure and enhance censorship resistance compared to existing blockchain platforms."
