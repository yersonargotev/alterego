  "marketPositioning": "Ludusavi is positioned as a comprehensive, cross-platform, and open-source game save backup solution that offers broad compatibility with various game launchers and an extensive list of supported games. It differentiates itself from older, Windows-only alternatives like GameSave Manager by providing multi-platform support, including Linux and Steam Deck, a larger database of recognized games, faster performance, and the flexibility of both GUI and CLI interfaces, along with cloud sync capabilities. Compared to built-in cloud saves, it offers a unified backup strategy across all platforms and allows for local backups and management of games without native cloud support. Its open-source nature also contributes to its appeal for users seeking transparency and community-driven development."
