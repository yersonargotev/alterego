  "marketPositioning": "flawz is positioned as a lightweight, terminal-native tool for quick and convenient browsing of CVE data, primarily from NVD. Its focus on a TUI provides a distinct experience compared to web-based databases or more complex vulnerability management platforms. It appeals to users who prefer command-line workflows and need direct access to vulnerability information without the overhead of a full web application or local database setup required by some alternatives. Its ease of installation across various platforms is a key differentiator for users already accustomed to package managers."
