  "marketPositioning": "Tokei is positioned as a fast, accurate, and versatile command-line utility and library specifically for counting lines of code. Its key differentiators include its speed (attributed to being written in Rust), high accuracy in handling comments, and support for a wide array of languages and output formats. Unlike broader platforms like SonarQube, Tokei focuses solely on code counting, making it a lightweight yet powerful tool for developers and teams who need quick and reliable code statistics without the overhead of a full static analysis suite. Its availability as a library also makes it suitable for integration into other development tools and workflows."
