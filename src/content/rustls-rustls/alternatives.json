  "marketPositioning": "Rustls is positioned as a secure, modern, and memory-safe alternative to traditional TLS libraries, written in Rust. It differentiates itself by explicitly avoiding legacy and unsafe features, focusing on modern TLS standards (1.2 and 1.3), and leveraging Rust's safety guarantees. It appeals to developers in the Rust ecosystem and those prioritizing enhanced security and performance, offering competitive speed and lower memory usage compared to widely used C/C++ alternatives like OpenSSL."
