  "marketPositioning": "Xilem is positioned as an experimental, high-performance, and productive Rust-native UI framework. It differentiates itself through a novel reactive architecture that synthesizes ideas from leading UI frameworks (Flutter, SwiftUI, Elm) while specifically addressing Rust's unique challenges around state management and ownership. Its focus on a fine-grained incremental computation engine, innovative event dispatch, and the use of the Vello rendering backend aim to provide both performance and an ergonomic developer experience within the Rust ecosystem. Unlike web-based solutions, it targets native performance, and compared to more established native toolkits (GTK, Qt), it offers a modern, Rust-idiomatic approach. Xilem is a project pushing the boundaries of Rust GUI development, aiming to offer a first-class native UI option for Rust developers."
