  "projectName": "cargo-buttplug",
  "projectPurpose": "To provide physical, haptic feedback (likely vibrations) during software development tasks using the Rust programming language and the Cargo build tool, serving as 'positive reinforcement' during coding sessions.",
  "platforms": [
    "Depends on the underlying Buttplug.io server and device support (typically Windows, macOS, Linux)"
  ],
  "mainFeatures": [
    "Cargo subcommand integration",
    "Connects to Buttplug.io server (e.g., Intiface Central)",
    "Provides physical feedback (haptics/vibrations) based on cargo command events",
    "Designed for 'positive reinforcement' during coding"

  "marketPositioning": "cargo-buttplug is positioned as a highly niche and experimental developer tool that applies the Buttplug.io framework, primarily used in entertainment, to the software development process. It uniquely offers physical feedback integrated directly into the Cargo build workflow for Rust developers. Its market is likely limited to developers interested in novel productivity hacks or humorous/unconventional coding experiences, leveraging the existing Buttplug.io hardware ecosystem rather than competing with core development tools."
