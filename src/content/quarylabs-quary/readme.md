2.  **Project Purpose:**
    Based on the description and features, Quary's purpose is to provide an open-source business intelligence (BI) tool specifically designed for engineers. It emphasizes a code-first approach to defining data transformations, models, and visualizations, integrating with version control for collaborative and iterative development of the BI layer directly within the database ecosystem.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Alternative Tools:**
    Given Quary's focus on open-source, engineer-centric BI with a code/SQL emphasis, potential alternatives include other open-source BI platforms, data transformation tools often used in conjunction with BI, and proprietary BI tools that might offer some level of engineer-friendly features or have significant market share.

    *   Open Source BI: Metabase, Apache Superset, Lightdash, Redash.
    *   Data Transformation (often used before BI): dbt (data build tool). While not a full BI tool, it's a key part of the "BI for engineers" stack.
    *   Proprietary/Commercial BI: Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Sisense, ThoughtSpot.

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on market presence and mentions in search results, **Microsoft Power BI** and **Tableau** are consistently cited as two of the most popular and widely used BI tools overall, dominating the market quadrants.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    Quary positions itself as "Open-source BI for engineers." This highlights a few key aspects of its positioning:
    *   **Target Audience:** Explicitly focuses on engineers, suggesting a tool that aligns with engineering workflows and technical preferences (e.g., code-first, version control).
    *   **Open Source:** Differentiates itself from the many proprietary BI tools, offering flexibility, transparency, and potentially lower cost.
    *   **Code-First/SQL-Centric:** By emphasizing writing SQL to transform, organize, and document data, it caters to users comfortable with code and databases, contrasting with some BI tools that prioritize no-code/low-code visual interfaces for business users.
    *   **Integration with Database Workflow:** The ability to deploy the organized model *back* to the database suggests a tighter integration with the data warehousing/ELT process than traditional BI tools that primarily connect for visualization.
    *   **Early Stage:** As an open-source project with some features "in development" (dashboards, reports), it is likely positioned as an emerging alternative challenging established players, particularly for teams with strong engineering talent who want more control over their BI infrastructure.

    Compared to alternatives:
    *   It's distinct from broad, user-friendly BI tools like Metabase or Power BI that aim for a wider audience including business users with less technical expertise.
    *   It shares some philosophy with Lightdash, which is also built around a code-first approach (specifically dbt).
    *   It overlaps with the data transformation aspects of dbt but extends into the visualization layer (though currently in development).
    *   It competes with other open-source BI tools like Apache Superset and Redash but focuses more narrowly on the engineer persona and a potentially deeper integration with the data modeling layer through code.

7.  **Expanded Description reflecting Market Positioning:**
    Quary is an open-source business intelligence platform built specifically for data engineers and analytics engineers. It adopts a code-first approach, allowing users to define their data sources, build robust data models using SQL transformations, and generate documentation, all managed under version control. By integrating directly with the database and supporting iterative development and testing, Quary empowers technical teams to build a reliable and well-defined semantic layer alongside their data warehouse, providing a foundation for generating charts, dashboards (in development), and reports (in development). Its focus on engineering workflows differentiates it from traditional BI tools that often target less technical business users, positioning Quary as a tool for teams who want more control, transparency, and integration with their existing data infrastructure and practices.
