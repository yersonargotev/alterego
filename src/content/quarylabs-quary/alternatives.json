  "marketPositioning": "Quary is an open-source business intelligence platform built specifically for data engineers and analytics engineers. It adopts a code-first approach, allowing users to define their data sources, build robust data models using SQL transformations, and generate documentation, all managed under version control. By integrating directly with the database and supporting iterative development and testing, Quary empowers technical teams to build a reliable and well-defined semantic layer alongside their data warehouse, providing a foundation for generating charts, dashboards (in development), and reports (in development). Its focus on engineering workflows differentiates it from traditional BI tools that often target less technical business users, positioning Quary as a tool for teams who want more control, transparency, and integration with their existing data infrastructure and practices."
