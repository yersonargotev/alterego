  "marketPositioning": "COSMIC Settings is positioned as the native, integrated configuration application for the new COSMIC desktop environment. As a core component of COSMIC, which is built from scratch in Rust with a focus on Wayland, its market position is tied to providing a modern, performant, and cohesive settings experience tailored for the COSMIC DE. While facing established alternatives like GNOME Control Center and KDE System Settings, cosmic-settings differentiates itself by being part of a new, independent desktop environment seeking to offer a distinct user experience and leverage modern technologies, with a design that supports modularity for distribution-specific customizations."
