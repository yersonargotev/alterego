  "marketPositioning": "Namada positions itself as a shielded asset hub and a composable privacy layer for the entire multichain ecosystem. Its key differentiator is providing asset-agnostic privacy across various chains, allowing users to shield any asset (fungible or non-fungible) and perform private cross-chain interactions within a unified shielded set. This contrasts with privacy solutions focused primarily on native coins or optional transaction privacy on a single chain. Namada also incentivizes privacy through shielding rewards, promoting privacy as a public good for the multichain network."
