  "marketPositioning": "Riverraidrust is positioned not as a general tool for creating text-based games or interactive fiction, but as a specific, niche implementation of a classic arcade game concept within the constraints of a text-based terminal interface, built using the Rust programming language. Its development during a stream also places it partly as an educational or demonstrative project for Rust development in this unconventional domain. It appeals primarily to Rust developers interested in terminal applications and retro game enthusiasts."
