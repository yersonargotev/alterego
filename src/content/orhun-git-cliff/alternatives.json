  "marketPositioning": "git-cliff is positioned as a highly customizable, developer-centric command-line changelog generator. While many tools generate changelogs from Conventional Commits, git-cliff differentiates itself through its emphasis on extensive customization options via configuration and regex-powered parsing, offering granular control over the output format. Unlike broader platforms that include feedback or roadmap features, git-cliff focuses specifically on the automated generation of changelogs from Git history, making it ideal for integration into development workflows and CI/CD pipelines. Its implementation in Rust may also appeal to users prioritizing performance and a self-contained executable."
