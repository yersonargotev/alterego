  "marketPositioning": "fuels-rs is positioned as the primary and idiomatic Rust SDK for the Fuel Network, a modular execution layer for Ethereum rollups. Unlike general-purpose blockchain SDKs or those for other specific chains (like Ethereum, Solana, or Cosmos), fuels-rs is purpose-built to interface with Fuel's unique architecture, FuelVM, and the Sway programming language. Its market position emphasizes enabling Rust developers to leverage Fuel's claimed advantages in performance, parallel execution, and developer experience for building dApps and interacting with the Fuel ecosystem, providing deep integration with Sway contracts and Fuel-specific tooling."
