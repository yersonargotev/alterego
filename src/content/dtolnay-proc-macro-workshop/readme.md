1.  **Extract and quote key information:**
    *   **Project Name:** "proc-macro-workshop"
    *   **Description:** "Learn to write Rust procedural macros\u2003\u2003[Rust Latam conference, Montevideo Uruguay, March 2019]"
    *   **Main Features:** The project itself is a workshop/tutorial. Its key "feature" is providing a structured way to learn about and practice writing Rust procedural macros. This implicitly involves understanding and using the core components of Rust's procedural macro system, such as `proc_macro`, `syn`, and `quote` crates.

2.  **Identify the project's purpose:**
    The project's purpose is educational. It serves as a hands-on workshop to teach developers how to write procedural macros in the Rust programming language. This involves explaining concepts like parsing Rust code (Abstract Syntax Trees), manipulating it, and generating new code at compile time.

3.  **Brainstorm potential alternative tools:**
    Since "proc-macro-workshop" is an educational resource rather than a tool for *using* or *writing* macros directly (it teaches the latter), alternatives would be other resources for learning Rust procedural macros. These could include:
    *   Official Rust documentation and books.
    *   Other tutorials and guides (blog posts, videos).
    *   Books specifically about Rust macros.
    *   Examples and source code of existing procedural macros.

5.  **Identify the most well-known or widely used alternative overall:**
    The most well-known and widely used alternative resources for learning Rust programming, including procedural macros, are the *official Rust documentation* and *The Rust Programming Language Book*. These are the canonical sources recommended for all Rust developers.

6.  **Analyze the market positioning:**
    "proc-macro-workshop" is positioned as a practical, hands-on learning experience specifically focused on *writing* procedural macros. While official documentation and books provide comprehensive information, this workshop offers a guided, exercise-based approach, often used in conference settings or for self-paced learning with a practical bent. It complements theoretical resources by providing concrete coding challenges. Its value lies in its structured, practical format, making it easier for learners to apply the concepts learned from more theoretical documentation.

7.  **Expanded description:**
    The "proc-macro-workshop" is a hands-on educational resource designed to guide Rust developers through the process of creating procedural macros. Originally developed for a Rust Latam conference, it provides a structured series of exercises that allow participants to learn by doing. The workshop covers the fundamental concepts and practical techniques required to write custom `#[derive]`, attribute-like, and function-like macros, utilizing essential crates like `syn` for parsing and `quote` for code generation. Its purpose is to move beyond theoretical understanding and equip developers with the practical skills needed to leverage Rust's powerful metaprogramming capabilities for reducing boilerplate and extending the language's syntax.
