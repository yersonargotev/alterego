  "marketPositioning": "Lapdev is positioned as a self-hosted alternative to cloud-based remote development environments like GitHub Codespaces and Gitpod. Its key differentiator is the emphasis on ease of installation and maintenance for users who prefer to host their own infrastructure. By leveraging the Devcontainer specification and offering horizontal scalability, Lapdev targets organizations and developers who need customizable, controlled, and scalable remote development solutions without relying on third-party SaaS providers. It competes with the self-hosted aspects of tools like Coder while potentially offering a simpler path to deployment for some users."
