  "marketPositioning": "Embassy is positioned as a modern, Rust-native embedded framework that strongly emphasizes the use of the async/await programming model for concurrency. While it competes with established embedded operating systems and RTOSes like FreeRTOS, Zephyr, RIOT, and Mbed OS, which are primarily C/C++ based (though some offer Rust support), Embassy differentiates itself by being built from the ground up for Rust and its async capabilities. It targets developers who prioritize Rust's safety features and wish to leverage a modern, asynchronous approach to embedded software development, standing alongside other Rust-based efforts like RTIC but with a distinct focus on async."
