        *   **Supported platforms:** Supports 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers, including ARM Cortex-M, AVR, MSP430, ESP32, RISC-V. Has a native port for Linux and BSD for development/simulation.
        *   **Main features:** Microkernel architecture, energy-efficiency, real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, uniform API (partially POSIX compliant), multiple network stacks (IPv6, 6LoWPAN, CoAP, MQTT, BLE, LoRaWAN), security features (DTLS, firmware updates), supports C, C++, and Rust.

    *   **Mbed OS:**
        *   **Name:** Mbed OS
        *   **Licensing:** Open Source - Apache License 2.0. (Note: Arm has announced end-of-life for Mbed OS in July 2026, with active development already halted).
        *   **Supported platforms:** Primarily 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.
        *   **Main features:** Designed for IoT devices, includes an RTOS core (based on CMSIS-RTOS RTX), standardized APIs, connectivity support, security features (uVisor, SSL/TLS), development tools (IDE, CLI).

    *   **RTIC (Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency):**
        *   **Name:** RTIC
        *   **Licensing:** Open Source (Typically MIT or Apache 2.0 for Rust crates, but the framework itself is a concurrency model rather than a full OS kernel). Specific crate licenses would need verification. (Based on community practices and The Embedded Rust Book).
        *   **Supported platforms:** Primarily ARM Cortex-M processors, and RISC-V with CLIC.
        *   **Main features:** Concurrency framework for Rust, leverages hardware for efficient scheduling (NVIC/CLIC), built on Stack Resource Policy (SRP) for compile-time guarantees against data races/deadlocks, preemptive multitasking, memory efficient (shared stack), supports async/await.
        *   **Website URL:** Often associated with the Rust Embedded Working Group; documentation is frequently found within the `cortex-m-rtic` or `rtic` crates on crates.io and in The Embedded Rust Book. (Example GitHub repo with RTIC examples: https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-embedded-examples)

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative Overall:**
    Based on search results and general embedded industry knowledge, **FreeRTOS** is widely considered the most well-known and widely used RTOS for microcontrollers globally.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    `embassy` positions itself as a *modern* embedded framework specifically utilizing *Rust* and *async*. While other embedded OSes like FreeRTOS, Zephyr, and RIOT are well-established and support a wide range of hardware and features, they are primarily C/C++ based (though RIOT has Rust support). RTIC is also Rust-based and focuses on interrupt-driven concurrency. `embassy` differentiates itself by fully embracing Rust's async/await paradigm for concurrent programming in the embedded space. This focus on modern language features and asynchronous operations in Rust is its key market differentiator. It targets developers who prefer Rust and its safety guarantees, and who want to use a modern concurrency model in their embedded projects. Its "modern" aspect likely refers to its design principles, leveraging Rust's features for safety and potentially easier concurrency compared to traditional callback-based or RTOS-task-based approaches in C/C++.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    Embassy is a modern embedded framework written in Rust that leverages the language's asynchronous programming features (async/await) to enable efficient and safe concurrent applications on embedded systems. It provides a framework for building embedded software that benefits from Rust's memory safety and type system guarantees, combined with the productivity and expressiveness of the async paradigm. Embassy aims to offer a high-level, yet performant, approach to embedded development, moving beyond traditional RTOS models often found in C/C++ and providing a compelling option for developers looking to build robust and maintainable embedded applications in Rust.
