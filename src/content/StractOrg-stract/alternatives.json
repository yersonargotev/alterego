Unlike many privacy-focused alternatives that rely on major engines, Stract boasts its own independent index and crawler. Its unique 'optics' feature allows for deep personalization of results, differentiating it from the less customizable nature of mainstream search engines and even many privacy-focused options. It directly challenges the dominance of proprietary search by offering a fully open and controllable platform focused on respecting user intent and privacy."
