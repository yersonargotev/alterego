5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Google Search is by far the most well-known and widely used search engine globally, dominating the market share.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    Stract positions itself as an open-source, independent, user-centric, and highly customizable web search engine.,,, While many alternative search engines focus primarily on privacy (like DuckDuckGo, Startpage), or combine search with other missions (like Ecosia planting trees or Brave with its browser ecosystem), Stract's key differentiators appear to be its fully independent index (not relying on Google or Bing results like some others), and its deep level of customization through "optics",, allowing users to finely tune search results based on criteria like site types (blogs, indieweb, educational) or how signals are combined. This targets a more technical audience ("tinkerers and developers"), who desire transparency and control over the search algorithm and results, contrasting with the black-box nature of major commercial search engines. Its open-source nature and focus on user control and transparency differentiate it from both major proprietary search engines and many other privacy-focused alternatives that might still rely on larger engines for their core results.,

7.  **Expanded Description based on official sources:**
    Stract is a fully open-source, independent, and user-centric web search engine hosted at stract.com., Targeted towards tinkerers and developers, it distinguishes itself by maintaining its own independent search index and crawler, rather than relying on results from other major search providers., Stract offers a keyword search that respects the user's query and provides advanced syntax options. A core feature is the use of "optics," which allows users to customize search results extensively, such as filtering for specific content types (blogs, indieweb, educational) or adjusting how search signals are weighted., Other features include DDG-style !bang syntax, sidebars for sites like Wikipedia and Stack Overflow, the ability to de-rank sites with third-party trackers, and options to prioritize trusted sites. Stract aims to provide a more transparent and controllable search experience, addressing concerns about SEO-driven content, AI-generated results, and ad/tracker heavy websites prevalent in other engines. Its development is supported by funding focused on improving performance and documentation, reflecting its commitment to being a viable, independent alternative for exploring the web "right."
