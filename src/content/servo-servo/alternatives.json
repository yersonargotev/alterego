  "marketPositioning": "Servo positions itself as a lightweight, high-performance, and secure web rendering engine, uniquely built in Rust for enhanced memory safety and concurrency. It aims to be a modular and embeddable alternative to established C++ based engines like Blink, WebKit, and Gecko. While currently more experimental, its focus on a modern language and parallel processing differentiates it for use cases requiring a secure and performable embedded web view or UI built with web technologies, particularly in embedded systems and applications leveraging WebGL/WebGPU."
