  "marketPositioning": "miniquad is a minimal, cross-platform rendering library for Rust developers. It provides a low-level API to handle window creation, input events, and graphics rendering across various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Web (WASM). Designed as a foundational layer, miniquad abstracts away platform-specific complexities, making it suitable for building custom graphics applications or serving as the base for higher-level frameworks and game engines like macroquad."
