  "marketPositioning": "GlazeWM is positioned as a free and open-source tiling window manager for Windows users seeking a minimalist, highly customizable, and keyboard-driven workflow akin to Linux tiling window managers like i3wm. It serves a niche audience on Windows that desires the efficiency of automatic window arrangement and workspace management over the traditional stacking or the more visually-oriented grid/snapping tools. Its direct inspiration from i3 sets it apart from general window snapping utilities, targeting power users and developers familiar with or migrating from command-line centric environments."
