  "marketPositioning": "The namada-trusted-setup-claimer is a highly specialized utility designed exclusively for participants of the Namada trusted setup ceremony. Unlike general-purpose digital signature tools or broad key management systems, its function is tightly coupled with the keys generated during this specific cryptographic event within the Namada ecosystem. Its market position is niche, serving the specific need of trusted setup contributors to sign messages for purposes such as verifying their participation, claiming airdropped tokens, or engaging with Namada network features that require validation from these unique keys. It is an essential, purpose-built tool for a specific set of users within the Namada community, rather than a competitor in the broader digital signature or key management market."
