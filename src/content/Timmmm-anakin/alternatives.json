  "marketPositioning": "anakin is a specialized command-line utility written in Rust designed to identify and terminate orphan processes on Linux-like systems. Unlike general process monitoring tools or system supervisors, anakin focuses specifically on cleaning up processes whose parent process has terminated, ensuring system hygiene and preventing potential resource leaks or unintended background execution of orphaned tasks. It provides a dedicated solution for a specific process management concern."
