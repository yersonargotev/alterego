  "marketPositioning": "Anki is positioned as a powerful, highly customizable, open-source spaced repetition flashcard program. It is favored by serious learners, particularly in demanding fields, due to its robust algorithm, content flexibility, extensive add-on ecosystem, and ability to handle large data sets. While its interface is often considered less modern than some competitors, its power and customization options, coupled with cross-platform syncing and a strong community, distinguish it from more consumer-oriented or language-specific alternatives. It is primarily a dedicated memorization tool, unlike some alternatives that integrate flashcards into broader knowledge management systems."
