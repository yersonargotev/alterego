  "marketPositioning": "postgres_lsp is positioned as a specialized and highly accurate language server for PostgreSQL, distinguishing itself by using the native PostgreSQL parser for unparalleled syntax compatibility. This allows it to offer more reliable and precise language intelligence features within code editors compared to generic SQL tools that use less specific parsers. Its transport-agnostic design suggests a future as a foundational piece of PostgreSQL tooling infrastructure usable across various development environments and workflows, aiming to significantly improve the developer experience for PostgreSQL users."
