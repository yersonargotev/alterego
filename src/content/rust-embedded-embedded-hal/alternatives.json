  "marketPositioning": "embedded-hal is positioned as a fundamental, language-native Hardware Abstraction Layer within the Rust embedded ecosystem. Unlike vendor-specific HALs or HALs integrated into larger RTOS frameworks, it provides a set of generic traits that define standard interfaces for embedded peripherals. This trait-based approach promotes maximum code portability and reusability for both hardware support crates and platform-agnostic device drivers written in Rust. Its focus is on providing a minimal, zero-cost abstraction that serves as the common ground for building a diverse ecosystem of embedded Rust software."
