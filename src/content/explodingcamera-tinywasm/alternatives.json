  "marketPositioning": "tinywasm positions itself as a highly lightweight and purely interpreted WebAssembly runtime written in Rust. While other runtimes like Wasmer and WAMR offer interpreter modes and projects like Wasmi and Wasm3 are also interpreters, tinywasm specifically emphasizes its 'tiny' nature. This suggests a market focus on extreme resource constraints or scenarios where minimal runtime size and fast initial load/startup (characteristic of interpreters) are the primary requirements, potentially differentiating it from runtimes that prioritize peak execution speed through complex JIT/AOT compilation."
