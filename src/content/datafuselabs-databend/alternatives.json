  "marketPositioning": "Databend is an open-source, cloud-native data warehouse built in Rust, designed to be a modern, cost-effective, and simple alternative to proprietary solutions like Snowflake. It focuses on providing high-performance analytics for massive-scale datasets, leveraging a decoupled storage and compute architecture similar to modern cloud data warehouses. Databend supports standard SQL for data analysis and is engineered for elastic scalability and efficient resource utilization, aiming to reduce the total cost of ownership for analytical workloads in the cloud. It positions itself by offering the flexibility and control of open source while competing on features and performance with established proprietary cloud data warehouses."
