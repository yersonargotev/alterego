Unlike general-purpose installer tools that require platform-specific configuration, cargo-dist leverages Cargo metadata to streamline the creation of various distributable formats (tarballs, installers) and assists with the overall release workflow, aiming to be a comprehensive, batteries-included solution for Rust developers distributing their applications."
