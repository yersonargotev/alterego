  "marketPositioning": "Difftastic is positioned as a specialized command-line diff tool that excels at comparing code and structured text by understanding their syntax. Unlike traditional line-based diff tools, it minimizes noise from formatting changes, offering a more accurate view of structural modifications. It stands apart from basic diff utilities and Git's built-in diff by its core structural comparison logic. While graphical tools like Beyond Compare and Meld offer visual interfaces and merging, they typically rely on line-based comparisons. Difftastic's strength lies in its precise, syntax-aware comparison and broad language support via tree-sitter, making it a powerful tool for developers who need clear and accurate code diffs, especially when integrated into existing command-line or Git workflows."
