  "marketPositioning": "bat positions itself as a modern, user-friendly, and feature-rich replacement for the standard 'cat' utility. It integrates capabilities typically found in separate tools (like syntax highlighters and pagers), such as automatic syntax highlighting, Git integration, and automatic paging, into a single command. This makes it a highly effective tool for developers and power users who frequently view code and text files in the terminal, offering a significantly enhanced viewing experience compared to the basic 'cat' or piping to 'less' and a highlighter."
