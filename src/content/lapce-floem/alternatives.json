  "marketPositioning": "Floem is positioned as a native Rust UI library that stands out due to its emphasis on fine-grained reactivity for performance optimization. While other Rust GUI libraries exist (like iced, egui, and Slint), and frameworks like Tauri leverage web technologies with a Rust backend, Floem focuses on providing a pure-Rust, native-feeling UI with an efficient reactive model. This positions it as a strong contender for Rust developers building performance-sensitive desktop applications who prefer a native approach over web views and value fine-grained control over UI updates."
