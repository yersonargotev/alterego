  "marketPositioning": "Makepad is positioned as a Rust-native, cross-platform creative software development platform. Unlike general-purpose GUI frameworks, it focuses on applications requiring native graphics API access (Metal, DX11, OpenGL) across desktop platforms and WebAssembly/WebGPL for web deployment, making it suitable for performance-sensitive and visually-oriented creative tools and applications. Its Rust-centric nature differentiates it from established C++ frameworks like Qt, while its integrated platform approach distinguishes it from immediate-mode GUI libraries primarily used for debugging or overlays."
