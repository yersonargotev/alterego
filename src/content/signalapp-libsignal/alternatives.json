  "marketPositioning": "libsignal is positioned as the reference and authoritative implementation of the Signal Protocol, specifically designed and maintained by the Signal Foundation to power its end-to-end encrypted messaging ecosystem. Unlike general-purpose cryptographic libraries, its focus is on providing the precise set of cryptographic functions and protocol implementations required for Signal's unique privacy and security features, including the Double Ratchet algorithm, secure device linking, and zero-knowledge groups. Its primary 'market' is the Signal platform itself, and its use outside of official Signal applications is explicitly stated as unsupported, distinguishing it from libraries aiming for broader adoption across diverse applications."
