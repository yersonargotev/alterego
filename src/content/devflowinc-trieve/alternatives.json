  "marketPositioning": "Trieve positions itself as a unified, all-in-one infrastructure for building modern AI-powered search, recommendation, and RAG applications. Unlike traditional search engines or pure vector databases, it integrates search language models and provides built-in tools for relevance tuning, aiming to simplify the development of intelligent data interaction systems. Its positioning targets developers looking for a comprehensive platform that goes beyond basic vector search or keyword matching, offering more control and potentially self-hosting options compared to proprietary SaaS alternatives like Algolia."
