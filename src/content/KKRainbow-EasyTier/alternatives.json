  "marketPositioning": "EasyTier is positioned as a simple, secure, and truly decentralized mesh VPN solution built upon the WireGuard protocol. Unlike solutions that rely on centralized control servers, EasyTier emphasizes a peer-to-peer architecture, appealing to users who prioritize full ownership, control, and resilience without a single point of failure managed by a third party. It offers a more user-friendly approach to establishing WireGuard mesh networks compared to manual configuration, while providing advanced features like NAT traversal and subnet proxying. Its open-source nature and focus on simplicity distinguish it from more feature-rich but potentially more complex or less decentralized alternatives like Tailscale or ZeroTier."
