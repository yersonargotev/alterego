  "marketPositioning": "PROST! is positioned as a key Protocol Buffers implementation within the Rust ecosystem. It focuses on generating idiomatic Rust code and providing efficient serialization/deserialization, making it well-suited for performance-sensitive Rust applications, particularly those in the Tokio asynchronous runtime environment. Unlike some alternatives, it intentionally omits runtime reflection, favoring a more compile-time oriented approach. While it requires the external `protoc` compiler, its strength lies in its deep integration with Rust language features and its maintainership by the prominent tokio-rs organization."
