  "marketPositioning": "Helios is positioned as a leading fast, secure, and highly portable multichain light client for the Ethereum ecosystem, including OP Stack networks. Its primary market differentiation lies in its ability to provide trustless data verification from untrusted RPC endpoints, requiring no local storage and syncing in seconds. This makes it uniquely suitable for resource-constrained environments like mobile devices, browsers (via WebAssembly), and embedded applications, where running traditional full or even light nodes is not feasible. While other clients offer light modes, Helios's explicit focus on trustless verification and minimal resource footprint gives it a distinct advantage for developers building decentralized applications and wallets that need verifiable blockchain access directly on user devices, without the overhead or trust assumptions of full nodes or purely RPC-based solutions."
