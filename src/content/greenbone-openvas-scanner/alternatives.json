  "marketPositioning": "The openvas-scanner is the core component of the Greenbone Community Edition (GCE), positioning it as a powerful, open-source vulnerability scanning engine within a larger open-source vulnerability management framework. Unlike proprietary alternatives such as Nessus, Qualys, and Rapid7 Nexpose, GCE offers a free and transparent solution for vulnerability assessment. It competes by providing a comprehensive feature set including diverse protocol support, performance tuning, a robust testing language, and integration capabilities, making it a strong choice for users and organizations prioritizing cost-effectiveness, customization, and control over their scanning infrastructure. Its role as the scanning engine in GCE allows it to serve as an accessible entry point into vulnerability management, complementing Greenbone's commercial offerings which provide additional enterprise-grade features and support."
