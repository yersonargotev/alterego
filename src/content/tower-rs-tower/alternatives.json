  "marketPositioning": "Tower is a foundational library in the Rust ecosystem designed to simplify the development of robust and modular asynchronous networking clients and servers. At its core is the `Service` trait, a flexible abstraction representing an asynchronous function that processes a request and returns a response or an error. This simple yet powerful abstraction allows Tower to be protocol-agnostic, applicable to various request/response-based protocols, not just HTTP. Tower promotes code reusability and maintainability through its `Layer` trait and `ServiceBuilder`, enabling developers to compose middleware (like rate limiting, timeouts, or logging) around existing services. Unlike opinionated, all-in-one web frameworks, Tower provides the essential building blocks and patterns, serving as an integration point for application logic, middleware libraries, and protocol-specific implementations. This makes Tower an excellent choice for developers building custom network services, RPC systems, or contributing to higher-level frameworks within the asynchronous Rust landscape."
