  "marketPositioning": "DORA positions itself as a modern, high-performance, and developer-friendly middleware for AI-based robotic applications. It differentiates itself from established players like ROS/ROS 2 by leveraging Rust for enhanced speed and low-latency communication through zero-copy data transfer. Its focus on a composable dataflow architecture and polyglot support aims to simplify development and integration, particularly for performance-critical AI workloads and distributed systems, offering an alternative for developers seeking higher performance and a more modern technology stack than traditional robotics middleware."
