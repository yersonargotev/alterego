  "marketPositioning": "Maturin is a specialized build and publishing tool uniquely positioned at the intersection of the Rust and Python ecosystems. Unlike general-purpose build backends or packaging tools, maturin provides a streamlined, idiomatic workflow specifically tailored for integrating Rust code (especially via PyO3, Uniffi) and also C/C++ (via CFFI) into Python packages. Its deep integration with Cargo and focus on the Rust-Python interop makes it the preferred tool for developers building Python libraries or applications with performance-critical components written in Rust. While other tools can technically achieve similar results through more manual configuration, maturin's niche focus offers significant ease of use and efficiency for Rust-centric projects, often used in conjunction with cross-platform wheel builders like cibuildwheel or higher-level managers like Poetry."
