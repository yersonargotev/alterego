  "marketPositioning": "Tsukimi is positioned as a simple, open-source, third-party desktop client specifically for Emby users on Linux. It offers a native GTK4 interface and utilizes popular open-source media players (MPV, GStreamer). While official Emby clients exist for Linux, tsukimi provides an alternative focusing on simplicity and native integration within the Linux desktop environment. Its partial compatibility with Jellyfin also makes it a viable option for users of that open-source media server. It caters to users who prefer open-source solutions and a dedicated desktop application over a web or less integrated client."
