  "marketPositioning": "Rustup holds a strong market position as the *official* and *recommended* tool for installing and managing the Rust programming language toolchain. Unlike many community-developed version managers for other languages, Rustup is the canonical method endorsed by the Rust project itself. This provides developers with an officially supported, integrated, and comprehensive solution for managing Rust compilers (stable, beta, nightly), the Cargo package manager, and other essential development tools and targets, directly from the source."
