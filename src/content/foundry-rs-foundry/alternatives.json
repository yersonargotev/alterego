  "marketPositioning": "Foundry is positioned as a high-performance, portable, and modular command-line toolkit for Ethereum application development. Written in Rust, it emphasizes speed, the ability to write tests directly in Solidity, and advanced testing and debugging features. This differentiates it from Node.js-based tools like Hardhat and the now sunsetting Truffle Suite, and the web-based Remix IDE, targeting developers who prefer a CLI-centric workflow and prioritize performance and in-depth testing capabilities."
