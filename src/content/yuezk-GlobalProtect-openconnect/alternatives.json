  "marketPositioning": "GlobalProtect-openconnect is positioned as a vital third-party, open-source GlobalProtect VPN client specifically for the Linux ecosystem. It addresses the need for a reliable and feature-rich client on Linux distributions where the official Palo Alto Networks client may be difficult to obtain, unsupported, or lack specific features like robust SSO/MFA support. By building upon OpenConnect and offering a modern GUI with Tauri (in its paid version), it provides a user-friendly experience that complements or replaces the command-line OpenConnect and offers broader compatibility and authentication features than potentially outdated official Linux clients."
