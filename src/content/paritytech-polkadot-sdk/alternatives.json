  "marketPositioning": "The Polkadot SDK is positioned as a leading modular and flexible framework for building highly customizable blockchain networks, particularly those designed for interoperability and shared security within the Polkadot ecosystem. Unlike general-purpose platforms focused solely on dApp deployment or frameworks primarily for permissioned enterprise chains, the Polkadot SDK empowers developers to build sovereign, application-specific chains (solochains or parachains) with built-in features for governance, staking, and forkless upgrades. Its emphasis on seamless cross-chain communication and pooled security for parachains distinguishes it within the landscape of blockchain development frameworks, offering a strong alternative for projects seeking a tailored, interconnected, and future-proof blockchain solution."
