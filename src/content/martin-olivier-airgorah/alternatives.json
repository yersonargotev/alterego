  "marketPositioning": "Airgorah is positioned as a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) wrapper for the widely used command-line aircrack-ng suite. It aims to make common WiFi auditing tasks, such as deauthentication attacks and password cracking, more accessible to users who prefer a visual interface over command-line tools. While leveraging the core functionality of aircrack-ng, its GUI is its primary differentiator compared to the original suite and other command-line focused tools like Kismet, Hashcat, and John the Ripper, which either focus on different aspects of network analysis or are general-purpose crackers. Airgorah specifically targets Linux users requiring a simpler approach to active WiFi security testing."
