While not a framework itself, its existence and comprehensiveness are crucial for developers choosing Actix Web, particularly those prioritizing speed and a wide array of built-in capabilities like WebSockets and streaming, differentiating it from Rust alternatives focused on minimal design or specific architectural patterns."
