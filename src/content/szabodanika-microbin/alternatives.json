Compared to dedicated tools like Shlink or Lufi, it offers a convenient blend of both capabilities in a single package. Its Rust foundation appeals to users prioritizing performance and safety in a self-hosted environment, serving as a privacy-conscious alternative to large commercial services like Bitly."
