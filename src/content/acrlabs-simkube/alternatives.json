  "marketPositioning": "SimKube is positioned as a specialized simulation tool for understanding and testing Kubernetes scheduling behavior. Unlike broader performance or load testing tools that interact with a full cluster, SimKube focuses specifically on the scheduler by using a Virtual Kubelet provider to simulate the data plane. This allows for scalable and cost-effective analysis of scheduling decisions and policies in a realistic, yet simulated, environment, potentially including the ability to record and replay real-world scenarios."
