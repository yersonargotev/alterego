  "marketPositioning": "bpftop is positioned as a specialized, real-time performance monitoring tool specifically for eBPF programs on Linux. Unlike general system monitors or broader eBPF toolkits, it provides a dynamic, continuously updated view focused on the runtime, event rate, and CPU usage of individual eBPF programs. This makes it a focused tool for developers and system administrators who need immediate, detailed visibility into eBPF program performance, complementing the capabilities of more general eBPF management tools like bpftool and the extensive tracing capabilities of BCC and BPFtrace."
