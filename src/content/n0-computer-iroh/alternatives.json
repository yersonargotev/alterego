  "marketPositioning": "Iroh is positioned as a developer toolkit for building reliable and performant peer-to-peer applications. Unlike end-user file synchronization tools (like Syncthing or Resilio Sync), iroh provides a lower-level library focused on simplifying P2P connectivity and data exchange using QUIC, handling complexities like NAT traversal automatically. Compared to decentralized protocols like IPFS, which focuses on content addressing and distributed storage, iroh appears more focused on direct, secure peer-to-peer communication and state synchronization between specific nodes, offering a foundation for a wider range of custom distributed applications beyond just file storage and retrieval."
