  "marketPositioning": "pgprolog is a niche procedural language handler for PostgreSQL, targeting users who require the specific capabilities of the Prolog logic programming paradigm within their database. Unlike standard imperative or SQL-based procedural languages like PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, or PL/Java, pgprolog offers a declarative, rule-based approach to server-side logic. Its positioning is unique, catering to use cases where Prolog's strengths in areas like complex rule evaluation, knowledge representation, and automated reasoning are beneficial for data processing and querying within PostgreSQL. While not as widely adopted as the mainstream procedural languages, it provides a distinct and powerful option for a specific set of users."
