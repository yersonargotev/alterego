  "marketPositioning": "Perses is positioned as a state-of-the-art, language-agnostic program reducer that distinguishes itself by leveraging formal syntax information (Antlr grammars) to guide the reduction process. This syntax-aware approach helps it avoid generating invalid code and improves efficiency and effectiveness compared to purely structural or line-based reduction methods. While language-specific tools like C-Reduce might achieve deeper reductions for their target languages, Perses offers broader applicability and a good balance of effectiveness and generality across a wide range of programming languages with less per-language engineering effort. It is a key tool in the research area of automated program reduction and is sometimes used in conjunction with newer techniques and tools like Vulcan to achieve even greater minimization."
