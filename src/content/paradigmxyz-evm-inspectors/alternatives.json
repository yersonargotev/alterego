  "marketPositioning": "evm-inspectors is positioned as a low-level Rust library providing granular access to EVM execution via hooks within the `revm` environment. Unlike higher-level debugging tools or full node clients, it focuses on enabling developers building custom EVM analysis tools, debuggers, and simulations in Rust to intercept and observe opcode-level execution directly. It serves a specific niche within the Rust-based Ethereum development ecosystem, acting as a foundational component for more complex tooling."
