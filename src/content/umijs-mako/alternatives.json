  "marketPositioning": "Mako positions itself as an extremely fast, production-grade web bundler, differentiating itself through its Rust foundation for performance. It aims to compete with existing bundlers by offering significantly faster build times while providing the reliability and features necessary for production environments. Its focus on speed aligns it with newer, performance-oriented tools like esbuild and Vite's build process, while its 'production-grade' claim suggests it seeks to be a viable alternative for complex applications traditionally built with tools like Webpack or Rollup."
