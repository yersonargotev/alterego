  "marketPositioning": "\"rust-practice\" is positioned as a personal, project-based learning supplement for Rust. Unlike formal documentation or structured interactive courses, it offers a view into an individual's journey of learning Rust through building small, practical code examples. Its value lies in providing diverse, 'real-world' (albeit tiny) project inspirations and demonstrating one learner's approach to applying Rust concepts, rather than serving as a primary, comprehensive, or interactive learning tool."
