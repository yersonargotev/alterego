  "marketPositioning": "ratatui is positioned as a modern, idiomatic Rust crate for building lightweight, efficient, and complex terminal user interfaces (TUIs). It differentiates itself by being Rust-native, offering a modern API, flexible backend support for cross-platform compatibility, and focusing on performance through its rendering model. It competes with TUI libraries in other languages by providing a similar level of abstraction while leveraging the performance and ecosystem benefits of Rust."
