  "marketPositioning": "Madara-cli is positioned as a specialized, high-level command-line tool within the Madara ecosystem, specifically designed to simplify the initial setup, installation, and management of Madara nodes and appchains. Unlike general blockchain CLIs or development toolchains that focus on contract interaction or broader framework features, madara-cli provides a streamlined experience tailored for bootstrapping Madara's Substrate-based Starknet sequencer. It serves as an essential entry point for developers and users looking to quickly deploy and manage their own instances of the Madara stack, complementing tools like Starkli which focus on interacting with the chain once it's operational."
