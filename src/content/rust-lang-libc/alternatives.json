  "marketPositioning": "`libc` is positioned as the fundamental and standard library within the Rust ecosystem for direct, low-level interaction with the C standard library and other platform-specific native interfaces. Unlike higher-level FFI abstractions, `libc` focuses on providing raw bindings, requiring developers to be mindful of memory safety and potentially use `unsafe` code. Its market is specifically Rust developers needing fine-grained control over system calls and seamless interoperability with C, serving as a critical building block for other libraries and applications that interface with the operating system or existing native code. It is the idiomatic way to perform raw FFI in Rust, tightly integrated with the language's capabilities and safety features, even when exposing inherently unsafe operations from the C world."
