  "marketPositioning": "Display-switch is positioned as a cost-effective, open-source alternative to traditional multi-monitor hardware KVM switches. It bridges the gap between software-only KVMs (which only share keyboard/mouse) and expensive hardware KVMs (which also switch displays) by using an inexpensive USB switch for peripheral switching and software-based DDC/CI commands for automatic monitor input switching. This makes it appealing to users seeking multi-monitor control without the significant investment in dedicated KVM hardware, relying instead on software automation and affordable components."
