  "marketPositioning": "Mio is positioned as the fundamental building block for high-performance, non-blocking network applications in Rust, sitting below full asynchronous runtimes like Tokio. It offers a Rust-native, low-level abstraction over operating system I/O event notification mechanisms (epoll, kqueue, IOCP) with a focus on minimal overhead and zero runtime allocations. It serves as a direct competitor in purpose to established cross-platform C/C++ libraries like libuv and Boost.Asio, providing Rust developers with a performant and safe option for direct OS I/O interaction."
