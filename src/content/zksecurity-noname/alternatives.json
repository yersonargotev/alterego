  "mostWellKnownAlternative": "Circom",
  "marketPositioning": "Noname is positioned as a dedicated programming language for writing zero-knowledge applications (zkapps). Unlike some alternatives tied to specific blockchain platforms (Aleo, Mina, StarkNet), its description doesn't specify a target chain, suggesting a potential aim for broader applicability in the ZK ecosystem. Its implementation in Rust aligns it with other performance-focused ZK tools. Compared to established DSLs like Circom or rapidly growing languages like Noir, Noname appears to be a newer entrant, potentially exploring different language design choices or targeting a specific niche within zkapp development."
