  "marketPositioning": "Volta positions itself as a modern, faster, and more comprehensive solution for managing the JavaScript/Node.js toolchain. It strongly emphasizes cross-platform support (including native Windows support), automatic project-based version switching via project configuration ('Toolchains as Code'), and a robust approach to managing global package binaries. While competing with Node.js specific version managers like nvm and fnm, Volta aims to manage the entire JS toolchain (Node, package managers, and binaries) in a unified and reliable way, making it particularly appealing for teams needing consistent environments across different operating systems."
