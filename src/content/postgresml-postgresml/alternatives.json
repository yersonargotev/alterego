  "marketPositioning": "PostgresML is positioned as a unique, open-source solution that deeply integrates GPU-accelerated AI/ML capabilities directly into PostgreSQL as a native extension. Its core value proposition is enabling developers to leverage their existing PostgreSQL infrastructure and SQL knowledge to build AI applications and RAG pipelines without complex data pipelines or separate ML platforms. This in-database approach minimizes data movement, enhances security, and offers potentially higher performance for inference compared to external model serving. It stands apart from cloud-native database ML features by being open-source and self-hostable, and differs from platforms like MindsDB by being a native database extension rather than a separate service."
