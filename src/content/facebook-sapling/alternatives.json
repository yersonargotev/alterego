  "marketPositioning": "Sapling is positioned as a highly scalable and user-friendly source control system designed to address the challenges of managing extremely large repositories (monorepos) while improving the developer experience, particularly for workflows involving commit stacks and history manipulation. Unlike traditional centralized systems like SVN and Perforce (in its core mode), Sapling is distributed. While competing with Git and Mercurial in the distributed VCS space, Sapling differentiates itself by focusing on superior scalability for massive codebases and enhanced usability features, including first-class support for commit stacks and intuitive history management via the Smartlog. Its Git compatibility allows it to serve as an alternative client for existing Git users and facilitates adoption."
