  "marketPositioning": "BiTE positions itself as a disassembler with a unique emphasis on providing comprehensive support for binaries compiled from the Rust programming language. While established tools like IDA Pro, Ghidra, Binary Ninja, and radare2 offer broad architectural support, BiTE aims to provide deeper, more integrated analysis capabilities specifically for the nuances of Rust binaries and their associated debug information. Its open-source nature and implementation in Rust differentiate it from commercial offerings and provide a specialized alternative within the broader reverse engineering tool landscape."
