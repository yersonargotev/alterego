Its key differentiators include support for a wider range of standalone VR headsets beyond just Meta Quest and compatibility with Linux on the PC side. While proprietary solutions like Virtual Desktop and platform-specific options like Oculus Air Link and Steam Link dominate the consumer market, ALVR serves users seeking flexibility, open development, and support for non-mainstream hardware or operating systems. It competes directly on the core functionality of wireless PC VR streaming while offering a community-driven, customizable experience."
