  "marketPositioning": "byo_mint is an open-source program, written in Rust, designed for minting compressed Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Solana blockchain. It focuses specifically on leveraging Solana's state compression technology, often implemented via the Metaplex Bubblegum program and the account-compression program, to significantly reduce the on-chain storage costs and improve the scalability of NFT minting compared to traditional Solana NFT standards. This project provides developers with a programmatic tool to implement cost-efficient and high-volume NFT minting directly within their Solana applications."
