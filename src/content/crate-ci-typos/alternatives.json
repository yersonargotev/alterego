  "marketPositioning": "typos is positioned as a fast, low false-positive source code spell checker built in Rust. Its core differentiator is its reliance on a curated list of known typo corrections rather than a comprehensive dictionary, which significantly reduces false positives in code. This makes it highly effective for automated checks in CI/CD pipelines. It also offers editor integrations via LSP, providing a balance between accuracy, speed, and developer workflow."
