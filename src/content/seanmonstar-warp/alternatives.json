  "marketPositioning": "Warp positions itself as a high-performance, super-easy, and notably composable web server framework for Rust, distinguished by its 'Filter' system. This system allows developers to define complex routing and request handling logic by composing smaller, reusable filter components, offering a functional approach that contrasts with the macro-based or more traditional handler-centric models of some competitors. By building on Hyper, it ensures a fast and robust HTTP foundation. Its market position emphasizes flexibility and fine-grained control through composition, appealing to developers who value this paradigm for building web services and APIs."
