  "marketPositioning": "monolith is positioned as a focused, efficient, and portable command-line tool for developers and users who prioritize a CLI workflow for archiving web pages into single, self-contained HTML files. Unlike browser extensions that offer a GUI and a wider range of features, monolith excels in its simplicity, speed, and ease of integration into scripts and automated tasks. Compared to general downloaders like Wget, its core strength lies in embedding assets directly into the HTML, creating a truly single-file archive. Its implementation in Rust further emphasizes its focus on performance and resource efficiency, appealing to users who need a reliable, no-frills solution for offline web page preservation via the command line."
