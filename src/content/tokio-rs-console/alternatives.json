  "marketPositioning": "tokio-rs/console is positioned as a specialized, essential diagnostic tool for the Rust async ecosystem, particularly for developers using the Tokio runtime. It fills a gap left by general-purpose debuggers by providing deep, interactive visibility into the state and behavior of asynchronous tasks, which is crucial for diagnosing concurrency issues in complex async applications. It complements the `tracing` infrastructure by offering a unique, debugger-like view tailored specifically for async runtime analysis."
