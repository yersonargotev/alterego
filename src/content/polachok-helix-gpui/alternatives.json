  "marketPositioning": "helix-gpui is positioned as a high-performance native GUI for the Helix text editor. It targets users who prefer the modal editing paradigm and performance characteristics of Rust-based editors like Helix but desire a modern graphical interface. By utilizing the GPUI framework, it aims to offer a smoother and more integrated graphical experience compared to using Helix within a terminal emulator or existing GUI frontends for similar editors, competing with other modal editor GUIs while emphasizing performance and native feel through its choice of UI framework."
