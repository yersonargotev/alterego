  "marketPositioning": "Cosmic-comp is positioned as the native and tightly integrated compositor for the new, Rust-based COSMIC desktop environment by System76. Unlike established compositors like Mutter and KWin which serve major desktop environments and often support both X11 and Wayland, cosmic-comp is exclusively focused on Wayland and the specific design philosophy of COSMIC. It is part of a ground-up effort to build a modern, performant, and cohesive desktop experience, differentiating itself from standalone compositors or those designed for broader compatibility across different desktop environments. Its development in Rust is a key aspect of its identity within the COSMIC ecosystem."
