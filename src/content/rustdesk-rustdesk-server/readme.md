5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on search results and general market presence, **TeamViewer** is widely considered the most well-known and widely used alternative overall in the remote desktop software market.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    RustDesk Server is positioned as the server component of an **open-source, self-hostable remote desktop solution**. Its key differentiators are its open-source nature, enabling transparency and community contributions, and the emphasis on self-hosting, which provides users with full control over their data and infrastructure for enhanced privacy and security. While many commercial alternatives offer robust features and ease of use, they typically rely on their own servers, which may raise data privacy concerns for some users. Open-source alternatives like Apache Guacamole and MeshCentral also offer self-hosting, but RustDesk aims for a balance of being full-featured and easy to set up. RustDesk is presented as a strong open-source alternative to popular proprietary tools like TeamViewer and AnyDesk, specifically targeting users who prioritize data sovereignty, security, and customization through self-hosting.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    RustDesk is a full-featured, open-source remote desktop software designed as a secure, private, and customizable alternative to commercial solutions like TeamViewer and AnyDesk. Its core offering includes a client application that works across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web) and a server program (rustdesk-server) that enables users to self-host their remote access infrastructure. By allowing users to run their own server, RustDesk emphasizes data sovereignty and enhanced security, keeping data under the user's control and facilitating regulatory compliance. The project utilizes P2P connections with end-to-end encryption based on NaCl for secure communication. Key features include remote control, file transfer, chat, and support for advanced network configurations. RustDesk aims for simplicity in deployment and offers advanced configuration options and the ability to customize the client with branding. The availability of an open-source client and a choice between a basic free/OSS server and a more featured Professional Server provides flexibility for different user needs.
