  "marketPositioning": "RustDesk Server is positioned as the crucial component enabling an open-source, self-hostable remote desktop solution. It directly competes with commercial remote desktop software like TeamViewer and AnyDesk by offering a privacy-focused alternative where users retain full control over their data and infrastructure. Its open-source nature fosters transparency and community development, while the emphasis on self-hosting appeals to users prioritizing data sovereignty, security, and customization, setting it apart from services that rely solely on vendor-provided servers."
