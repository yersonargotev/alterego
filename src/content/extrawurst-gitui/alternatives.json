  "marketPositioning": "Gitui is positioned as a high-performance, terminal-based Git UI written in Rust. It stands out by offering a fast and responsive interactive experience within the command line, particularly excelling with large repositories where graphical GUIs might struggle. It targets developers who prefer to remain in the terminal but desire a more visual workflow for common Git operations than the standard CLI, differentiating itself from both full-featured graphical clients and simpler terminal browsers through its speed, comprehensive TUI features, and keyboard-centric design."
