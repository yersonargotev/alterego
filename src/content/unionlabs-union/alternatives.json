  "marketPositioning": "Union positions itself as a cutting-edge, highly secure, and decentralized cross-chain bridging and interoperability protocol. Its primary differentiator is its deep reliance on zero-knowledge cryptography and consensus verification for trust minimization, explicitly avoiding traditional trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC for core validation. This focus on trustlessness and censorship resistance, combined with its hyper-efficient ZK proving system and support for both EVM and IBC chains, targets the DeFi market and users prioritizing the highest levels of security and decentralization compared to alternative bridging solutions that may employ different trust assumptions like validator networks or MPC schemes."
