  "marketPositioning": "Substrate is positioned as a highly flexible and modular framework for building custom blockchain networks, catering to 'blockchain innovators' who require more control and customization than traditional smart contract platforms like Ethereum offer. Its key differentiators are its Rust/Wasm runtime, forkless upgrades, and native interoperability capabilities, particularly within the Polkadot ecosystem. While competing with other blockchain SDKs like Cosmos SDK for building application-specific chains, Substrate emphasizes runtime flexibility and its connection to the Polkadot shared security model. It stands apart from enterprise-focused frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric by not being limited to permissioned networks and providing tools for a broader range of decentralized applications."
