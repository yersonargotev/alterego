  "marketPositioning": "Ratatui positions itself as a core, lightweight TUI rendering library for the Rust ecosystem. As a fork of tui-rs, it emphasizes continued development and community contributions. Unlike higher-level frameworks that may include built-in event loops or application structures, Ratatui focuses on providing a robust set of widgets and layout tools with an immediate rendering model. This approach gives developers maximum flexibility and control over their application's architecture, event handling, and state management, making it a preferred choice for Rust developers who need a powerful rendering engine without the constraints of a full framework."
