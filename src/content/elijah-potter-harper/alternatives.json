  "mostWellKnownAlternative": "Grammarly",
  "marketPositioning": "Harper is positioned as a niche, privacy-first, and high-performance grammar and spell checker specifically for the developer community. It differentiates itself from broader consumer-focused tools like Grammarly and LanguageTool by prioritizing on-device operation for data privacy and tailoring its functionality to the technical writing context of developers, such as ignoring code blocks. Its open-source nature further appeals to this audience, offering transparency and extensibility compared to predominantly proprietary alternatives. While other tools offer wider language support and more extensive stylistic analysis, Harper focuses on providing core grammar and spell checking efficiently and securely within the developer workflow."
