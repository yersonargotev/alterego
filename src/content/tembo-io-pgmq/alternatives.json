  "marketPositioning": "pgmq is positioned as a lightweight, integrated message queue solution specifically for developers and organizations already using PostgreSQL. It offers a simpler alternative to deploying and managing separate message broker systems like Kafka or RabbitMQ, leveraging the existing database infrastructure for message durability and reliability. Its key appeal lies in its ease of use and tight integration within the Postgres ecosystem, targeting use cases where the full complexity and scale of dedicated brokers are not required, but persistent and transactional messaging is beneficial."
