  "marketPositioning": "Fnm positions itself as a fast, simple, and natively cross-platform Node.js version manager built with Rust. It competes primarily with nvm by offering better performance and out-of-the-box Windows support, unlike the standard nvm which is POSIX-centric. While Volta also offers speed and cross-platform support via Rust, Fnm focuses solely on Node.js version management, providing a less opinionated and potentially simpler solution compared to Volta's broader toolchain management. Against universal managers like asdf and mise, Fnm offers a specialized tool for users who only need Node.js versioning, potentially simplifying setup. Its core appeal lies in its speed and seamless cross-platform usability powered by Rust."
