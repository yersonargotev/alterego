    *   Name: volta
    *   Licensing: Open Source - BSD 2-Clause
    *   Supported platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux.
    *   Main features: Per-project version management via `package.json`, automatically switches Node.js and package manager versions, manages global tool binaries, built in Rust for speed.
    *   Website URL: https://volta.sh/

*   **asdf:**
    *   Name: asdf
    *   Licensing: Open Source - MIT
    *   Supported platforms: macOS, Linux.
    *   Main features: Universal version manager for multiple languages (using plugins), consistent CLI for all languages, supports `.tool-versions` and existing config files (`.nvmrc`, etc.), automatically switches versions based on directory.
    *   Website URL: https://asdf-vm.com/

*   **mise (formerly rtx):**
    *   Name: mise
    *   Licensing: Open Source - MIT
    *   Supported platforms: Likely macOS, Linux, and potentially Windows (given its Rust base and asdf compatibility, though docs primarily mention Unix-like systems).
    *   Main features: Fast (built in Rust), asdf-compatible (uses asdf plugins), polyglot (manages multiple languages), no shims by default, supports `.tool-versions`, `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`.
    *   Website URL: https://mise-en-place.github.io/

5.  **Identify the most well-known or widely used alternative:**
    Based on GitHub stars and general community recognition, **nvm** (specifically nvm-sh/nvm for Unix-like systems) is historically the most widely known and used Node.js version manager. However, for native Windows, `nvm-windows` is the prevalent choice. Volta is also gaining significant traction, particularly for its project-centric approach and performance.

6.  **Analyze Market Positioning:**
    `fnm` positions itself as a "Fast and simple Node.js version manager, built in Rust". Its core differentiators are:
    *   **Speed:** Being built in Rust is a major factor contributing to its performance, often highlighted as faster than shell-script-based managers like `nvm`.
    *   **Simplicity:** Aims for a straightforward user experience.
    *   **Cross-Platform (Native):** Unlike the primary `nvm` which is POSIX-compliant, `fnm` is designed to work natively across Windows, macOS, and Linux without requiring WSL or separate projects like `nvm-windows`.
    *   **Rust Implementation:** Appeals to developers who value performance and the safety features of Rust.

    Compared to alternatives:
    *   **vs. nvm:** `fnm` is generally faster and offers native cross-platform support out-of-the-box, whereas `nvm` is primarily for Unix-like systems and requires `nvm-windows` for native Windows. `nvm` has a larger user base and longer history.
    *   **vs. n:** `fnm` is cross-platform and manages versions per-shell or per-project more effectively than `n`'s more global approach.
    *   **vs. nvs:** Both are cross-platform and offer similar core version switching. `fnm` emphasizes speed through Rust.
    *   **vs. volta:** Volta also uses Rust for speed and offers native cross-platform support. Volta's key differentiator is its strong focus on per-project toolchain management (Node, npm/yarn/pnpm, global bins) integrated via `package.json`. `fnm` focuses purely on Node.js versions.
    *   **vs. asdf/mise:** These are universal version managers that handle many languages via plugins. `fnm` is specialized for Node.js, which can mean a simpler setup if only Node.js is needed. `mise` (rtx) is also built in Rust and aims for speed and asdf compatibility.

    `fnm` carves out a market position for users who specifically need a fast, simple, and natively cross-platform Node.js version manager, leveraging the performance benefits of Rust without the broader scope of universal managers like `asdf` or the more opinionated project-centric approach of `volta`.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    Fast and simple Node.js version manager, built in Rust. Fnm is a command-line tool designed to allow developers to easily install, manage, and switch between multiple versions of Node.js on their system. Its core philosophy emphasizes speed and simplicity, achieved through its implementation in the Rust programming language. Unlike some alternatives that are shell-script-based or require specific environments like WSL on Windows, Fnm is built to be a native, performant solution across Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing a consistent experience regardless of the operating system. It enables quick installation of different Node.js versions and allows effortless switching, supporting common workflows including the use of `.nvmrc` files for project-specific version requirements.
