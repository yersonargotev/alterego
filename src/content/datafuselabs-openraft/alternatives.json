  "marketPositioning": "Openraft is positioned as an advanced, next-generation Raft consensus algorithm implementation in Rust. Unlike full-fledged distributed systems like etcd, Consul, or ZooKeeper, which are built on top of consensus algorithms and provide higher-level services (key-value store, service discovery, etc.), Openraft provides the core consensus engine. Its market position is as a foundational library for developers building high-performance, reliable distributed data storage systems and other distributed applications in the Rust ecosystem, offering potential improvements over other available Raft libraries in Rust."
