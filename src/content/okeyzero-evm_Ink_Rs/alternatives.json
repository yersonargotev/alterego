  "marketPositioning": "evm_Ink_Rs is a fast and universal command-line tool written in Rust designed specifically for performing inscription operations across a variety of EVM-compatible blockchain networks. It supports popular chains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (Matic), Avalanche (AVAX), and OKXChain, among others within the EVM ecosystem. The tool leverages the performance of Rust to enable rapid execution of inscription tasks, offering a specialized solution compared to general-purpose blockchain interaction libraries or CLIs. Its core focus is on providing an efficient workflow for users looking to embed data onto these blockchain networks."
