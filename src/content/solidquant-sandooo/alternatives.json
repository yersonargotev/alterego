  "marketPositioning": "sandooo is a highly specialized, open-source tool positioned within the niche area of DeFi algorithmic trading, specifically focused on executing 'sandwich attacks'. Unlike broader trading bots that offer a variety of strategies across different markets, sandooo targets a specific Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) opportunity on decentralized exchanges. Its development in Rust suggests a focus on performance critical for competitive MEV strategies, distinguishing it from general-purpose platforms or bots which may not offer the low-level control and speed required for this specific use case. Its market position is as a tool for advanced users looking to engage in or understand the mechanics of DeFi sandwich trading."
