  "marketPositioning": "Zola is positioned as a high-performance, user-friendly static site generator that emphasizes ease of installation and a batteries-included approach by providing essential features within a single binary. It competes with other fast generators like Hugo but distinguishes itself with its Tera templating engine and comprehensive set of built-in functionalities. Compared to more extensible, dependency-heavy, or framework-based options like Jekyll, Eleventy, Gatsby, or Next.js, Zola offers a simpler, more streamlined experience, particularly appealing to users who prioritize speed, minimal dependencies, and integrated features for content-focused static websites."
