  "marketPositioning": "Positioned as a specific, highly optimized demonstration of the binary greedy meshing algorithm within the Rust ecosystem. It serves as an educational resource and proof-of-concept rather than a general-purpose library or a complete voxel engine component. Its primary value is showcasing the performance potential of this specific meshing technique in Rust, differentiating it from broader voxel libraries or engines that may offer multiple meshing algorithms or more extensive features."
