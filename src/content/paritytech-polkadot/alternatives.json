  "marketPositioning": "Polkadot is positioned as a leading platform for blockchain interoperability and a foundational layer for Web3. Its unique architecture, featuring a central Relay Chain providing shared security to connected parachains, differentiates it from many other blockchain platforms that operate as single, independent chains. While competitors like Cosmos also focus on interoperability, Polkadot's pooled security model is a key distinction. Polkadot aims to enable a diverse ecosystem of specialized blockchains to seamlessly interact and share data, addressing critical challenges of scalability and interoperability faced by earlier blockchain generations."
