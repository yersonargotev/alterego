It targets users who need the power and high-quality output of LaTeX for complex documents (especially in technical and academic fields) but desire a significantly easier learning curve, faster workflow, and more intuitive syntax. It differentiates itself with its integrated scripting, consistent design, rapid compilation with instant previews, and clear error messages, addressing key pain points of LaTeX. Compared to WYSIWYG editors, Typst offers the benefits of a markup approach for structure, consistency, and handling complex elements more effectively."
