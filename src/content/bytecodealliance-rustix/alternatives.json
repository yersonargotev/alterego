  "marketPositioning": "Rustix is positioned as a safe, idiomatic, and efficient low-level systems programming library for Rust, primarily on Unix-like systems and Linux. It differentiates itself from raw FFI bindings like `libc` by prioritizing memory and I/O safety through Rust's type system and providing more ergonomic APIs. While the Rust standard library (`std`) offers higher-level portable abstractions, rustix provides safe access to a broader range of underlying syscalls. Compared to other binding crates like `nix`, rustix emphasizes I/O safety types and offers flexible backends, including direct syscalls, making it a strong candidate for foundational libraries and applications requiring fine-grained, safe control over OS interfaces."
