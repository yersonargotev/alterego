  "marketPositioning": "cargo-mommy is positioned as a unique developer morale tool within the Rust ecosystem. Unlike general terminal amusement tools (like fortune or cowsay) or standard build notification systems, it focuses on providing personalized, emotionally supportive, and highly customizable textual feedback tied directly to the outcome of Rust cargo commands. Its value lies in enhancing the developer's subjective experience by injecting personality and encouragement into the build process, rather than providing technical features or performance improvements."
