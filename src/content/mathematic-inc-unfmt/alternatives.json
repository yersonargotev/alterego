  "marketPositioning": "unfmt is positioned as a specialized, compile-time string pattern matching library for Rust, specifically designed to reverse the `format!` interpolation process. Its key advantage lies in performing parsing at compile time, offering performance benefits and type safety over runtime-based solutions like general-purpose regular expressions or sscanf implementations that rely on them. While less flexible than full parser combinators or advanced regex engines, unfmt provides a lightweight, familiar-syntax approach for extracting data from fixed-format strings."
