  "marketPositioning": "FnckSQL positions itself as a unique alternative to traditional Rust ORMs and database drivers by implementing a \"SQL as a Function\" paradigm. This approach aims to provide a functional and potentially more idiomatic way to compose and execute SQL queries directly within Rust code, differentiating it from libraries that focus on full ORM mapping or more traditional query builder patterns."
