  "marketPositioning": "Avian is uniquely positioned as a native, ECS-driven 2D/3D physics engine built specifically for the Bevy game engine. While general-purpose physics engines like Rapier, Box2D, Bullet, PhysX, and Havok exist and are widely used across the industry, Avian's core strength lies in its deep integration with Bevy's architecture, aiming to provide a more ergonomic, performant, and idiomatic physics solution for Bevy developers compared to using wrappers around external libraries. It competes directly within the Bevy ecosystem by offering a comprehensive feature set tailored to the engine's data-driven design."
