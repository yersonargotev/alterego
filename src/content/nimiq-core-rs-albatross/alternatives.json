  "marketPositioning": "Core-rs-albatross is positioned as the foundational Rust implementation of the Nimiq project's high-performance Albatross Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol. Unlike broad blockchain frameworks, it's a specific core implementation tailored for Nimiq's goal of providing a frictionless and highly performant payment protocol for the web. It competes with other blockchain core implementations and platforms, particularly those focused on Proof-of-Stake and high transaction throughput, leveraging the safety and performance benefits of Rust for its specific use case within the Nimiq ecosystem."
