  "marketPositioning": "Materialize is positioned as a real-time streaming database that allows users to query live data streams using standard SQL. It differentiates itself from general-purpose stream processing frameworks by providing a database-like experience with a strong emphasis on SQL and automatically maintaining incremental materialized views. Compared to SQL interfaces built on specific messaging systems like ksqlDB (for Kafka), Materialize aims to be a more general platform connecting to various sources. It competes with traditional real-time analytical databases by offering native, continuous processing of streaming data. Its core value proposition is enabling low-latency, up-to-date queries on fast-changing data with the ease of SQL."
