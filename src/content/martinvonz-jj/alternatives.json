It targets developers who use Git but seek a simpler model for managing changes and history, aiming to improve productivity and reduce complexity associated with Git's staging area and traditional history rewriting commands. By maintaining Git compatibility, it allows users to leverage the existing Git ecosystem while adopting a different internal model and command set focused on changesets and seamless history editing."
