  "marketPositioning": "Rustlings is positioned as a practical, command-line-based learning tool that focuses on hands-on practice and understanding Rust compiler output through small, fixable exercises. It serves as a complementary resource to theoretical learning materials like 'The Rust Programming Language Book', offering a distinct approach from broader web-based coding platforms or interactive online courses by emphasizing direct interaction with the local Rust environment and toolchain."
