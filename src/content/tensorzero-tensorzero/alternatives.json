  "marketPositioning": "TensorZero is positioned as a comprehensive, open-source, self-hostable LLMOps framework targeting engineers building production-grade LLM applications. It differentiates itself by unifying a high-performance LLM gateway, robust observability, explicit optimization tools, evaluation, and experimentation into a single platform, forming a continuous feedback loop. This contrasts with tools primarily focused on only observability or evaluation, or commercial platforms that may lack the open-source/self-hosted flexibility and performance-oriented gateway."
