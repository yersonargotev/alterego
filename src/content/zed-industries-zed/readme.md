5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on recent surveys and widespread adoption, **Visual Studio Code** is the most well-known and widely used code editor overall.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    Zed is positioning itself as a *high-performance, collaborative, and AI-ready* code editor. Its core differentiator is its focus on speed and efficiency, achieved by being built in Rust and directly leveraging system resources, which the creators contrast with editors built on frameworks like Electron (which powers VS Code and Atom). The built-in, real-time collaboration features are another key selling point, aiming to provide a seamless pairing and team coding experience without relying solely on external plugins. Furthermore, Zed is actively integrating AI-powered coding capabilities, positioning itself as a forward-looking editor for the age of LLMs. While it is currently primarily available on macOS and Linux, its plan for Windows and Web support indicates an ambition for broader reach. Compared to established editors like VS Code, Zed emphasizes raw performance and integrated collaboration/AI features as its primary advantages, whereas VS Code's strength lies in its vast extension ecosystem and broader platform support. Compared to Vim/Emacs, Zed offers a more modern UI and aims for a simpler out-of-the-box experience, while still providing customization options like Vim keybindings. Its open-source nature (with some potential for future proprietary commercial features) allows for community contribution while exploring monetization strategies beyond traditional licenses or ads.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    "Code at the speed of thought – Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter. Engineered from scratch in Rust, Zed is designed for superior speed and responsiveness, efficiently utilizing multiple CPU cores and the GPU for a smooth coding experience, even with large projects. It stands out with its built-in, real-time collaboration features, allowing developers to work together seamlessly with shared workspaces, chat, and screen sharing. Zed is also forward-looking, integrating AI-powered coding assistance and native Git support directly into the editor. While currently available for macOS and Linux, with Windows and Web support in development, Zed offers extensive customization options through themes, plugins, and adjustable settings, including first-class modal editing via Vim bindings. As an open-source project, Zed aims to foster community contributions while exploring a business model that prioritizes user experience over ads."
