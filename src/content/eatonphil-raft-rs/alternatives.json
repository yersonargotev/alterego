  "marketPositioning": "raft-rs is positioned as a minimal and understandable implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Rust. Unlike more comprehensive libraries that include built-in solutions for networking, persistence, and state machine integration, raft-rs focuses primarily on the core Raft logic. This makes it suitable for developers who need a foundational Raft component and prefer to build the surrounding infrastructure tailored to their specific distributed system requirements. Its minimalistic nature may also appeal to those seeking to learn or audit a concise Raft implementation."
