  "marketPositioning": "Stacks is positioned as the leading platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications that leverage the security and capital of Bitcoin. Unlike other major smart contract platforms that operate with their own independent security models (like Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche), Stacks is uniquely anchored to Bitcoin through its Proof of Transfer consensus mechanism. This allows it to inherit Bitcoin's unparalleled security guarantees and unlock Bitcoin's potential for programmatic use cases without altering Bitcoin's core protocol. Its market position is defined by being the primary gateway for developers and users to bring Web3 functionality, such as DeFi and NFTs, directly onto the most secure and decentralized blockchain network, Bitcoin."
