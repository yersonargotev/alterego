  "marketPositioning": "exa positions itself as a modern and enhanced replacement for the standard 'ls' command, targeting command-line users who desire a more visually appealing and informative file listing experience. By offering features like color-coding, icons, Git integration, and a tree view out-of-the-box or with simple options, it differentiates itself from the basic functionality of 'ls', 'dir', and 'vdir'. It competes with other modern alternatives like lsd and colorls by emphasizing performance (due to being written in Rust) and a comprehensive set of features. The existence and popularity of the 'eza' fork highlight the strong demand for exa's feature set and its impact on the command-line utility landscape."
