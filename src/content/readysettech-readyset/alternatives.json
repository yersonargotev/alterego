  "marketPositioning": "ReadySet is positioned as a 'smart' database proxy specifically focused on providing a transparent, wire-compatible caching layer for MySQL and PostgreSQL. Its key differentiator is the automatic, incremental updating of cached query results based on the database's replication stream, eliminating the need for manual cache invalidation and application code changes required by many other caching solutions like Redis, Memcached, or traditional application-level caching. It offers the ease of deployment of a proxy combined with the consistency and efficiency benefits of automatically maintained query result caches, standing out from proxy-based solutions that rely solely on TTL or application-level caching that requires extensive development effort."
