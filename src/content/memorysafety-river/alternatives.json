  "marketPositioning": "River positions itself as a modern, memory-safe reverse proxy built on Cloudflare's high-performance pingora library. Its primary advantage lies in using Rust to minimize memory safety vulnerabilities, differentiating it from widely used proxies like Nginx and HAProxy (written in C/C++). While Caddy offers ease of use and automatic HTTPS and is written in Go (with better memory safety than C/C++), River leverages pingora's proven performance at scale. Envoy is strong in cloud-native environments with dynamic configuration, but River targets users who may prefer declarative file-based configuration (KDL). River competes by offering a blend of high performance, memory safety, and essential reverse proxy features, aiming to be a secure and reliable alternative in the proxy landscape."
