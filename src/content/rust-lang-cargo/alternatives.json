  "marketPositioning": "Cargo is positioned as the official and tightly integrated package manager and build tool specifically for the Rust programming language. Its strength lies in providing a standardized and comprehensive workflow for managing dependencies, building, testing, and publishing Rust code within its dedicated ecosystem (crates.io). While alternative package managers exist for other languages and system-level software, Cargo is the de facto standard for Rust development, offering a unified and opinionated approach tailored to the language's unique features and conventions."
