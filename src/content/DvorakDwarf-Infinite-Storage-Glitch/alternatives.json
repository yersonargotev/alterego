  "marketPositioning": "Infinite-Storage-Glitch is positioned as a highly unconventional and experimental cloud storage solution that uniquely leverages YouTube's infrastructure for storing arbitrary files. Its primary appeal lies in the potential for free, very large-scale storage by repurposing a popular public platform, differentiating it significantly from traditional proprietary and open-source cloud storage providers that operate dedicated infrastructure. It targets users interested in technical novelty and maximizing free resources rather than those seeking enterprise-grade features, seamless collaboration, or guaranteed reliability."
