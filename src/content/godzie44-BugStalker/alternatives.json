  "marketPositioning": "BugStalker is positioned as a specialized debugger specifically for the Rust programming language on the Linux x86-64 platform. While general-purpose debuggers like GDB and LLDB offer Rust support as part of their broader language and architecture coverage, BugStalker's focused scope suggests a potential for deeper integration with Rust's unique language features and tooling, aiming to provide a more tailored and potentially streamlined debugging experience for Rust developers within its specific target environment compared to more general alternatives."
