  "marketPositioning": "openapi-tui is positioned as a specialized API interaction tool for developers who prefer a terminal-based workflow. Unlike comprehensive GUI clients like Postman or Insomnia, it focuses on providing an interactive TUI experience specifically for exploring and testing APIs defined by OpenAPI specifications. It offers a more structured interface than generic command-line tools like curl or HTTPie when working with OpenAPI, bridging the gap between raw command-line utilities and full-fledged graphical API platforms. Its strength lies in catering to a terminal-centric development style while leveraging the detailed information provided by OpenAPI documents."
