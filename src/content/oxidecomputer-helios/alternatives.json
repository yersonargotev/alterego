  "marketPositioning": "Helios is positioned not as a standalone operating system or hypervisor, but as a fundamental component of the Oxide Rack's vertically integrated 'cloud computer' system. It differentiates itself by being tightly coupled with custom hardware, replacing traditional firmware with a holistic software design, and providing a pre-integrated, API-driven private cloud experience, contrasting with general-purpose OS and hypervisor alternatives that run on commodity hardware and require separate management layers to achieve similar cloud-like capabilities."
