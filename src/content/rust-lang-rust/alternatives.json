  "marketPositioning": "Rust is positioned as a modern systems programming language that offers the performance and low-level control of C/C++ while providing strong memory safety and concurrency guarantees without a garbage collector. Its unique ownership and borrowing system distinguishes it by preventing common memory-related errors at compile time, making it a strong choice for building reliable, efficient, and safe software in domains traditionally dominated by C and C++, as well as in areas requiring safe concurrency like network services and embedded systems, offering a compelling alternative to languages like Go and Zig by providing more explicit memory control."
