  "marketPositioning": "AIChat positions itself as a comprehensive, all-in-one CLI tool distinguished by its extensive integration with over 20 diverse AI platforms and models. While other CLI tools exist, AIChat's strength lies in providing a single terminal interface to access a broad spectrum of AI capabilities, from major commercial APIs to local open-source models. Its focus on a rich CLI experience with features like Shell Assistant, Chat-REPL, RAG, and agent support caters specifically to developers and power users who prioritize command-line efficiency and require flexibility across multiple AI backends. It competes by offering greater model variety and terminal-native features compared to general web interfaces, and broader platform support compared to other multi-model CLI tools."
