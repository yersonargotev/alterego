  "marketPositioning": "Roc is positioned as a fast, friendly, pure functional programming language designed for building reliable, multi-platform applications. It aims to differentiate itself by offering a balance of performance typically associated with systems languages, the safety and testability of pure functional programming, and a strong emphasis on developer friendliness to make functional programming more accessible. Its ability to compile to various architectures and WebAssembly, coupled with its clear syntax and error handling, targets developers who need performant backend or cross-platform solutions without the complexity often found in traditional functional or systems languages. It seeks to fill a niche for pure functional programming beyond frontend development (unlike Elm) while being potentially more approachable than Haskell or OCaml, and offering different paradigms compared to multi-paradigm languages like Scala or F#."
