  "marketPositioning": "Anyhow is positioned as a flexible and convenient error handling solution primarily for Rust applications. It provides a simple, concrete error type that minimizes boilerplate and focuses on ease of use and error propagation with added context. This contrasts with libraries like `thiserror`, which are more focused on defining structured, specific error types suitable for public library APIs."
