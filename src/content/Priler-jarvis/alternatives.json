  "marketPositioning": "Jarvis is positioned as a niche, technically focused open-source voice assistant project that prioritizes privacy, offline operation, and transparency by utilizing neural networks for core voice AI functions without relying on cloud services or data collection. Unlike the dominant proprietary cloud-based assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri) or even more established open-source alternatives like Mycroft AI or Rhasspy which may offer broader platform support or integrations, Jarvis appears to be more of an experimental exploration of building the core neural network components of a voice assistant in a fully offline, privacy-preserving manner using a modern tech stack. Its current language limitation and experimental nature suggest it is aimed more at developers and privacy-conscious users interested in the underlying technology and the principles of offline, open-source voice control rather than being a direct, feature-complete competitor to mainstream assistants."
