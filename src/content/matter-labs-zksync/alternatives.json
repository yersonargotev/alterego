  "marketPositioning": "zkSync is positioned as a leading Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK-rollup) scaling solution for Ethereum, emphasizing trustless security and faster transaction finality compared to optimistic rollups. With its focus on EVM compatibility in zkSync Era, it aims to attract existing Ethereum developers and applications, competing directly with other ZK-rollup implementations like StarkNet and indirectly with dominant optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as other scaling solutions like Polygon PoS. Its core value proposition lies in leveraging the cryptographic guarantees of ZK proofs for a highly secure and efficient scaling experience."
