  "marketPositioning": "zkBitcoin is positioned as a pioneering project in the emerging field of bringing zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable computation (zkApps) directly to the Bitcoin network. It differentiates itself from traditional Bitcoin Layer 2s like Lightning or sidechains by focusing specifically on ZKPs for enhanced functionality and privacy. Its architecture, utilizing an off-chain MPC committee for verification and on-chain Bitcoin UTXOs for data availability, offers a unique approach compared to other ZK-on-Bitcoin efforts like ZeroSync (focused on light clients/base layer) or BitSNARK (focused on direct mainnet proof verification). It competes within the niche but growing market of enabling more complex and private applications on top of Bitcoin's secure base layer."
