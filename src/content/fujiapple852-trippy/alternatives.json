  "marketPositioning": "Trippy is positioned as a modern, advanced, and highly customizable command-line/TUI network diagnostic tool that builds upon the foundation of traditional utilities like ping, traceroute, and MTR. It offers a richer feature set than standard MTR, including advanced ECMP support, forward/reverse loss analysis, jitter measurement, and enhanced visualization, while remaining open-source and cross-platform. It targets network professionals and power users who need detailed network path and performance analysis capabilities beyond what basic built-in tools provide, differentiating itself from comprehensive enterprise monitoring suites by its focus on direct, on-demand diagnostics via a powerful terminal interface."
