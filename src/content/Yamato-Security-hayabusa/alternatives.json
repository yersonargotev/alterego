  "marketPositioning": "Hayabusa is positioned as a specialized, high-performance, open-source command-line tool for fast forensics and threat hunting specifically focused on Windows event logs. Its key advantages are its speed (built with Rust and multi-threading) and its comprehensive, native support for the Sigma rule format, including v2 correlation rules, which it highlights as a unique feature among open-source alternatives. Unlike broader SIEM or log analysis platforms that require more infrastructure, Hayabusa provides a dedicated and efficient way for security analysts and forensicators to quickly process and analyze Windows event logs and generate actionable timelines based on standardized detection rules."
