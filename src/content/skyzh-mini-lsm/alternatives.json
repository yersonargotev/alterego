  "marketPositioning": "mini-lsm is positioned as an educational tutorial for developers to learn the practical implementation of an LSM-Tree storage engine in Rust. Unlike production-grade key-value stores like RocksDB or LevelDB, its primary goal is knowledge transfer through hands-on coding rather than providing a ready-to-use database component. It serves as a code-centric alternative or complement to theoretical resources like 'Database Internals', specifically focusing on the LSM-Tree data structure."
