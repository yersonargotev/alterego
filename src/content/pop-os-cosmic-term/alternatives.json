  "marketPositioning": "COSMIC Terminal (cosmic-term) is positioned as the native, high-performance terminal emulator for the new COSMIC desktop environment by System76. By building upon the Alacritty framework, it emphasizes GPU acceleration and speed, differentiating itself from traditional terminal emulators. Its primary market is users adopting the COSMIC desktop, offering a tightly integrated command-line experience within that ecosystem. While still under development, its focus is on providing a performant and cohesive terminal for the future of the COSMIC environment."
