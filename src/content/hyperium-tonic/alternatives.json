  "marketPositioning": "Tonic is positioned as a native Rust implementation of gRPC, differentiating itself from gRPC libraries based on the C core (like grpcio-rs) by offering deep integration with Rust's async/await features. This focus on native Rust asynchronous programming provides an appealing alternative for developers building high-performance, idiomatic gRPC services and clients within the Rust ecosystem, competing primarily with other language-specific official gRPC libraries and the C-core based Rust implementation by emphasizing Rust-native advantages."
