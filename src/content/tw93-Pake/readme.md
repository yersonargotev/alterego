5.  **Identify Most Well-Known Alternative:**
    Based on common usage and the number of popular applications built with it, Electron is arguably the most well-known and widely used alternative for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies.

6.  **Analyze Market Positioning:**
    Pake positions itself as a "lightweight" and "multi-platform" tool for turning webpages into desktop apps, specifically highlighting the use of Rust. Compared to Electron and NW.js, which bundle a full Chromium browser and Node.js runtime, Pake's use of Rust and potentially system webviews (like Tauri) suggests a focus on smaller binary sizes and potentially better performance or lower resource usage. Its simplicity in the stated goal ("Turn any webpage into a desktop app") indicates it might be aimed at users or developers who want a quick and efficient way to wrap web content without the full complexity of a feature-rich framework like Electron or Tauri. Nativefier is similar in its goal of quickly wrapping websites but is built *on* Electron, which Pake aims to be a lighter alternative to by using Rust. Thus, Pake positions itself as a lighter, Rust-based alternative to Electron/NW.js and potentially a more fundamental building block compared to Nativefier, offering a different approach focused on efficiency and minimalism via Rust.

7.  **Expanded Description of Pake:**
    Based on the GitHub description, Pake is a tool built with Rust that provides a simple and lightweight way to convert any webpage into a cross-platform desktop application. It emphasizes ease of use ("轻松构建" - easily build) and minimal overhead ("轻量级" - lightweight), offering a Rust-powered alternative to frameworks that might result in larger application sizes. It aims to make creating desktop wrappers for web content accessible across multiple operating systems.
