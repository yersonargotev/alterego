  "marketPositioning": "Pake is positioned as a lightweight, Rust-based alternative for creating desktop applications from webpages. Unlike heavier frameworks like Electron or NW.js that bundle full browser runtimes, Pake aims for smaller binary sizes and potentially better performance by leveraging Rust. It offers a simpler approach compared to more complex frameworks like Tauri, focusing specifically on wrapping web content for desktop use across multiple platforms. Its use of Rust is a key differentiator, appealing to developers seeking efficiency and a smaller footprint."
