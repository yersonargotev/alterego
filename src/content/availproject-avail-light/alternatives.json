  "marketPositioning": "The avail-light client is positioned as a key component of the Avail modular blockchain ecosystem, specifically focused on providing trust-minimized and resource-efficient verification of data availability on the Avail DA layer. Its core strength lies in leveraging Data Availability Sampling (DAS) and erasure coding, offering security guarantees comparable to full nodes with minimal computational overhead. This distinguishes it from more general light clients and positions Avail as a specialized data availability layer enabling scalable and modular blockchain architectures. It competes directly with other modular data availability layers like Celestia and offers an alternative approach to data verification compared to traditional blockchain light clients."
