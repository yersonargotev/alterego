  "marketPositioning": "Socketioxide is positioned as a high-performance, memory-safe, and reliable Socket.IO server implementation for the Rust ecosystem. It differentiates itself by leveraging Rust's core strengths and integrating deeply with the standard Tower/Tokio asynchronous stack, providing a familiar Socket.IO development experience with the performance benefits of Rust. While the original Node.js Socket.IO is the most widely known and used, Socketioxide targets developers specifically building real-time applications in Rust who require robust Socket.IO features and seamless integration with the Rust asynchronous web landscape, offering a compelling alternative for performance-critical applications."
