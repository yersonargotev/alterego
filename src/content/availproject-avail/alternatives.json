  "marketPositioning": "Avail positions itself as a dedicated, horizontally scalable data availability layer and unification platform for the modular blockchain ecosystem. It differentiates itself through specific technical implementations like faster data availability verification for light clients via validity proofs and DAS, a focus on broad compatibility with various execution environments, and a unique multi-asset staking mechanism (Avail Fusion) for enhanced security. It competes directly with other dedicated DA layers like Celestia and EigenDA, while also complementing or offering an alternative to the DA capabilities of established L1s like Ethereum."
