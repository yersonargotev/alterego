  "marketPositioning": "Fuel Core is positioned as the foundational node software for the Fuel Network, a novel modular execution layer designed specifically for scaling Ethereum. Unlike traditional Layer 1 nodes (like Geth, Nethermind, or Reth) that focus on the base chain, or typical Layer 2 solutions (like Arbitrum or OP Mainnet) that often rely on EVM compatibility, Fuel differentiates itself with its custom-built FuelVM and Sway programming language. This unique stack aims to unlock higher performance, parallel transaction execution, and a more flexible development environment tailored for the future of decentralized applications. Fuel Core is therefore positioned not just as *another* node implementation, but as the entry point to a distinct and highly optimized Layer 2 ecosystem."
