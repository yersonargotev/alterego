  "marketPositioning": "Hyper is positioned as a foundational, low-level, and high-performance HTTP library for Rust. It is designed for developers building higher-level web frameworks, proxies, or other network infrastructure in Rust where control over the raw HTTP protocol and maximum performance are critical. Unlike more 'batteries-included' HTTP clients like reqwest or web frameworks like Actix Web, Hyper provides the core components. Compared to HTTP libraries in other languages, its key differentiator is leveraging Rust's memory safety and concurrency model to offer a reliable and efficient base layer for HTTP in the Rust ecosystem."
