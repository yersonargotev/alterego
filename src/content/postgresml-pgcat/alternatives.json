  "marketPositioning": "Pgcat is positioned as a modern, high-performance, and comprehensive middleware solution for PostgreSQL. Unlike traditional single-threaded poolers like PgBouncer, pgcat is multi-threaded, offering better resource utilization and concurrency. Its key differentiator is the integration of connection pooling, sophisticated sharding logic that routes queries directly, load balancing, and failover into a single layer. This provides a more unified approach to scaling and ensuring high availability compared to solutions that require combining multiple tools (e.g., a separate pooler, a generic load balancer, and application-level sharding). Written in Rust, it emphasizes performance and reliability. Pgcat competes as a more feature-rich alternative to basic poolers and load balancers, offering built-in sharding capabilities that are distinct from full distributed databases like Citus or application-managed sharding."
