  "marketPositioning": "Microsoft's \"Sudo for Windows\" is positioned as an official, modern command-line tool for streamlined privilege elevation on Windows, specifically targeting users familiar with the Unix/Linux `sudo` command. It differentiates itself from the traditional `runas` command by focusing on elevating the current user's process via UAC for single commands, providing a more ergonomic experience for this specific task. Its open-source nature and backing by Microsoft establish it as the official solution in this niche, complementing existing elevation methods rather than replacing them entirely."
