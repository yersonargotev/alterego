  "marketPositioning": "Asciinema is positioned as the leading open-source tool for recording and sharing terminal sessions in a lightweight, text-based format (.cast). It differentiates itself from traditional screen recorders by capturing terminal output as text and timing data, enabling features like copy-paste from playback, resolution independence, and smaller file sizes. Its integrated ecosystem (recorder, player, server) provides a comprehensive solution for technical demonstrations, tutorials, and troubleshooting, offering a modern, interactive alternative to static text logs or heavy video files. It competes with older tools like script and ttyrec by offering modern web sharing/embedding, and with GIF-generating tools by providing a more feature-rich, interactive playback experience via its dedicated player."
