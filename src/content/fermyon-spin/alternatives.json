  "marketPositioning": "Spin is positioned as an open-source, Wasm-native developer tool that simplifies building and running serverless applications. It differentiates itself from major cloud provider FaaS offerings by being vendor-neutral and specifically focused on the performance, security, and portability benefits of WebAssembly. Compared to other open-source serverless frameworks, Spin offers a streamlined, Wasm-first development experience that aims for faster startup times and lower overhead than traditional container-based approaches. It serves developers looking for an efficient and flexible way to build serverless applications outside of a single cloud ecosystem, leveraging the emerging standard of WebAssembly."
