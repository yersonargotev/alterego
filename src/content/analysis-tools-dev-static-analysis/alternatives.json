  "marketPositioning": "The 'static-analysis' project and its associated website analysis-tools.dev are positioned as a central, comprehensive, and community-driven hub for discovering and comparing a wide array of static analysis tools and linters across diverse technologies. Unlike individual tools that perform analysis (e.g., SonarQube, Veracode), this project acts as a curated directory, providing developers and teams with a valuable starting point to navigate the complex landscape of static code analysis solutions for code quality and security. Its broad scope and community contributions differentiate it from more narrowly focused lists or commercial marketplaces."
