  "marketPositioning": "Ripgrep is positioned as the leading high-performance, modern command-line search tool specifically optimized for developers and codebases. It builds upon the core functionality of traditional tools like grep and the developer-focused features of ack and The Silver Searcher, but significantly surpasses them in speed and efficiency through its Rust implementation, parallel processing, and intelligent defaults like comprehensive .gitignore support and full Unicode handling. It aims to be the fastest and most capable recursive regex search tool available, offering first-class support across major operating systems."
