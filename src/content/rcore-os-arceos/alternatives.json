  "projectPurpose": "ArceOS is an experimental operating system project focused on building a highly modular OS kernel and framework using the Rust programming language. Its purpose is to explore and demonstrate the benefits of modularity and Rust's safety features in OS development, supporting various architectures and providing core OS components and drivers. It aims to be a base for building different forms of operating systems.",

  "marketPositioning": "ArceOS positions itself as a research-oriented, highly modular operating system framework built with Rust. Unlike monolithic kernels, it emphasizes a component-based design where kernel services can be used independently or combined to form various OS configurations. Its use of Rust highlights a focus on modern language features for safety and reliability, distinguishing it from C-based systems like MINIX 3 and Zephyr. While similar to Redox OS in its use of Rust, ArceOS appears more focused on the experimental and framework aspects, aiming to provide a flexible base for exploring different OS structures rather than presenting a complete, immediately usable desktop OS like Redox. Compared to Google's large-scale Fuchsia project, ArceOS is a smaller, academic-driven initiative exploring modularity and Rust in the OS space."
