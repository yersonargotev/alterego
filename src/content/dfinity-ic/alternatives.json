  "marketPositioning": "The Internet Computer (ICP) is positioned as a 'World Computer' and a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud computing platforms, aiming to host the entire stack of decentralized applications directly on a public blockchain. Its key differentiators include powerful 'canister' smart contracts, web-speed performance, scalability, direct integration with other blockchains via chain-key cryptography, and a reverse-gas model making it free for end-users. This places it in direct competition with both other blockchain platforms and traditional centralized cloud providers, focusing on building a censorship-resistant and fully decentralized internet."
