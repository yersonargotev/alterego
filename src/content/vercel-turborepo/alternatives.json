  "marketPositioning": "Turborepo is positioned as a modern, high-performance build system specifically for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos. It differentiates itself with its focus on speed achieved through aggressive caching and parallelization, its implementation in Rust, and its ease of adoption compared to more complex multi-language build systems like Bazel or feature-heavy toolkits like Nx. While Lerna is a historical leader in the JS monorepo space, Turborepo is a newer entrant emphasizing out-of-the-box performance. Rush targets large enterprise monorepos with a broader toolchain, while Turborepo focuses on core build system efficiency for JS/TS."
