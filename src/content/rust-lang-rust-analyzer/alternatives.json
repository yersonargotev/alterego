  "marketPositioning": "rust-analyzer is the leading open-source Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for the Rust programming language. It is positioned as the official and recommended tool to provide rich, IDE-like features such as code completion, navigation, diagnostics, and refactoring support to any compatible code editor that supports the LSP. This makes it a flexible alternative to monolithic IDEs for Rust development, catering to developers who prefer using lightweight, configurable editors while still demanding a state-of-the-art development experience."
