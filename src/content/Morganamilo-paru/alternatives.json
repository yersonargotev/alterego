  "marketPositioning": "Paru is positioned as a modern, feature-packed command-line AUR helper and pacman wrapper for Arch Linux, serving as a primary alternative to the popular 'yay'. It differentiates itself by being written in Rust, offering potentially better performance and memory safety, and by implementing 'saner' default behaviors such as requiring PKGBUILD review. It targets Arch Linux users comfortable with the command line who seek an efficient, comprehensive, and actively maintained tool for managing packages from both official repositories and the AUR."
