  "marketPositioning": "StyLua is positioned as a dedicated, opinionated, and high-performance code formatter for the diverse Lua ecosystem. Its key strengths lie in its comprehensive support for a wide range of Lua versions and dialects, including those used in specific communities like Roblox (by following the Roblox Lua Style Guide). Being written in Rust likely contributes to its performance. It competes with general-purpose formatters like Prettier (via a plugin) and other Lua-specific formatters. StyLua differentiates itself through its explicit multi-dialect support and its opinionated approach tailored for Lua developers seeking a consistent and automated code style."
