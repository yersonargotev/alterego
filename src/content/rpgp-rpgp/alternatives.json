  "marketPositioning": "rPGP is positioned as a foundational OpenPGP library for developers, particularly within the Rust ecosystem, emphasizing a pure Rust implementation for enhanced safety and memory safety. Its permissive MIT/Apache 2.0 license distinguishes it from some alternatives, making it suitable for a wider range of integration scenarios. Unlike comprehensive end-user tools like GnuPG or direct command-line replacements like Sequoia's `sq`, rpgp focuses on providing a flexible, low-level API for embedding OpenPGP capabilities into other applications. Its use in projects like Delta Chat and various Rust-based development tools highlights its role as a core library component."
