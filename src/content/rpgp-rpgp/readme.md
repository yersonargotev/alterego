2.  **Project Purpose:** The project's purpose is to provide a robust, secure, and flexible library for implementing OpenPGP functionality in applications, specifically focusing on a pure Rust implementation with a permissive license. It aims to be a foundational component for developers building OpenPGP-aware software.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Alternative Tools:**
    *   Other OpenPGP libraries in different languages (C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Haskell, etc.)
    *   Command-line OpenPGP tools (like GnuPG)
    *   Higher-level libraries or tools built on top of OpenPGP implementations
    *   Commercial OpenPGP implementations
    *   Alternative encryption tools (though the focus is OpenPGP)

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:** GnuPG (GPG) is widely considered the most well-known and widely used OpenPGP implementation globally. It's a de facto standard for command-line OpenPGP operations and is integrated into many other tools and systems.

6.  **Market Positioning:** rpgp is positioned as a foundational OpenPGP library for developers, specifically those working in the Rust ecosystem or who prioritize a pure Rust implementation for security and memory safety reasons. Its permissive license (MIT or Apache 2.0) makes it attractive for a broader range of projects compared to alternatives with more restrictive licenses like GPL (used by GnuPG) or Sequoia's license (though also open source, described as more restrictive than rpgp's). While GnuPG is a comprehensive end-user tool and library, and Sequoia aims to be a direct replacement tool, rpgp focuses on providing a flexible, low-level API library for integration into other applications. Its adoption by projects like Delta Chat and various Rust-based tools (like those for RPM, Debian packaging, and Git signing) demonstrates its use case as a core OpenPGP component within other software.

7.  **Expanded Description of rpgp:** rPGP is an OpenPGP implementation written entirely in pure Rust, offered under a permissive license (MIT or Apache 2.0). It adheres to the OpenPGP standard as defined in RFC9580 (including the latest v6 key formats and AEAD) and supports older formats from RFC4880 and RFC6637 (like v3 keys and signatures). Designed with application developers in mind, rPGP provides a flexible, low-level API that facilitates building OpenPGP functionality into various software projects. Its pure Rust implementation contributes to its focus on safety and correctness. rPGP is intended as a library component rather than a direct command-line tool replacement like GnuPG or Sequoia's `sq`. It is used in production by applications such as Delta Chat and serves as a base for other Rust libraries and tools in the OpenPGP ecosystem.
