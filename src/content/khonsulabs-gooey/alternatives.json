  "marketPositioning": "\"gooey\" is positioned as an experimental, early-stage cross-platform GUI library for Rust. Unlike more established Rust GUI options or bindings to mature toolkits, it is still in active development and exploration. Its position is currently niche within the Rust GUI ecosystem, appealing to developers interested in contributing to or experimenting with new GUI paradigms in Rust. Its future market standing will depend on its progress, unique features, and community adoption compared to more mature and widely used alternatives like Iced, egui, and gtk-rs, or even solutions leveraging existing frameworks like Qt via cxx-qt."
