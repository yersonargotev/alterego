  "marketPositioning": "snarkVM is positioned as the foundational off-chain execution environment for the Aleo blockchain, specifically tailored for private, programmable computations using zk-SNARKs. Unlike many alternatives focused on EVM compatibility for Ethereum scaling, snarkVM is integral to Aleo's native privacy-preserving Layer 1 architecture. It executes programs written for the Aleo ecosystem (Aleo Instructions/Leo) and works in conjunction with SnarkOS for on-chain proof verification. Its market is centered around developers and users building and interacting with private applications on Aleo, emphasizing privacy through ZK executions."
