  "marketPositioning": "\"crypto-ecosystems\" is positioned as a foundational, open-source project focused on providing a structured taxonomy for the open-source cryptocurrency, blockchain, and decentralized ecosystem projects. Unlike commercial data platforms (like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Messari, Dune Analytics, Token Terminal) that prioritize market data, trading insights, or on-chain analytics, this project's core offering is the organizational framework itself. Its open-source nature encourages collaborative development of the classification system, making it a unique resource for researchers and developers seeking to understand the structure and relationships within the decentralized open-source landscape rather than just market performance."
