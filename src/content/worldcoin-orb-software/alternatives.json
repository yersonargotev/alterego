  "marketPositioning": "The orb-software holds a unique market position as the dedicated operating software for the proprietary Worldcoin Orb hardware. Unlike general-purpose biometric SDKs or identity verification platforms that can be integrated into various systems, this software is purpose-built for a specific device within the Worldcoin ecosystem. Its positioning is not as a direct competitor in the broader biometric software market but rather as the foundational software enabling the Orb's function of verifying human uniqueness through iris scanning to facilitate the creation of a World ID. Its open-sourcing is positioned as a measure of transparency for the Worldcoin project rather than making it a general-purpose open-source biometric tool."
