  "marketPositioning": "IronRDP is positioned as a modern, secure, and performant open-source RDP protocol implementation written in Rust. Unlike comprehensive end-user focused alternatives like FreeRDP and xrdp, IronRDP provides the core RDP library components for developers to build their own custom RDP clients and servers. Its Rust foundation appeals to developers prioritizing memory safety and performance. Its use in commercial products, including those enabling browser-based access via WebAssembly, highlights its strength as a library for integration into advanced remote access solutions."
