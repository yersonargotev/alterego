  "marketPositioning": "Hubris is positioned as a lightweight, memory-safe RTOS for deeply embedded systems, differentiating itself primarily through its implementation in Rust, which provides inherent memory protection. While competing in the open-source embedded RTOS space with established players like FreeRTOS and Zephyr, Hubris emphasizes a stronger, compile-time approach to safety compared to their C/C++ based implementations that rely more on hardware features like MPUs. It targets applications where code robustness and security are critical, offering a potentially more reliable foundation than traditional C-based RTOSes without the complexity and cost of high-end commercial options like QNX."
