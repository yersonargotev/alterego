  "marketPositioning": "JSR positions itself as a modern, TypeScript-first, and runtime-agnostic package registry designed to enhance the JavaScript ecosystem. Unlike the dominant npm registry, JSR natively supports TypeScript source publishing, enforces ESM, and offers enhanced security and quality features. Its key differentiator is its focus on the evolving needs of modern JavaScript and TypeScript development across diverse runtimes, while ensuring interoperability with existing npm-based workflows and package managers like Yarn and pnpm. JSR aims to be a forward-thinking alternative and complement to the traditional npm registry."
