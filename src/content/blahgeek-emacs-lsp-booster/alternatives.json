  "marketPositioning": "emacs-lsp-booster is a specialized performance optimization tool uniquely positioned to address performance bottlenecks experienced by Emacs users utilizing LSP clients like lsp-mode or eglot. Unlike the LSP clients themselves, which provide the core LSP functionality, or general-purpose editors like VS Code that offer built-in performant LSP experiences, emacs-lsp-booster acts as a targeted enhancement layer. Its value proposition lies in providing a dedicated, external solution (written in Rust) to improve the speed and responsiveness of LSP interactions within the Emacs environment, catering specifically to users who prefer Emacs but require better LSP performance without switching editors or undertaking extensive Emacs Lisp performance tuning."
