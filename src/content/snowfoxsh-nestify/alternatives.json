  "marketPositioning": "Nestify is a specialized tool within the Rust ecosystem focused on developer ergonomics for defining complex, nested data structures. It serves as a syntactic sugar layer that reduces the boilerplate associated with manual struct declarations, particularly for use cases like mapping API responses. Positioned as a complement to standard libraries like Serde rather than a replacement, it targets developers seeking cleaner, less verbose code for their data type definitions, differentiating itself by providing a unique macro-based approach to simplifying nested structure syntax."
