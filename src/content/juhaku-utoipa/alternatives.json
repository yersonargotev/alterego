  "marketPositioning": "Utoipa is positioned as a native, efficient, and code-first solution for generating OpenAPI documentation specifically for the Rust ecosystem. Its compile-time generation and macro-based approach differentiate it from general-purpose OpenAPI tools like Swagger UI (which visualizes specs) or OpenAPI Generator (which typically generates code from specs). It competes more directly with other Rust-specific code-first documentation generators like Aide, emphasizing its simplicity, speed, and compile-time nature. It caters to Rust developers who prefer to keep their API documentation closely tied to their source code and automatically generated during the build process."
