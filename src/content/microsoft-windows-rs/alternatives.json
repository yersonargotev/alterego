  "marketPositioning": "windows-rs is positioned as the premier solution for Rust developers seeking deep, safe, and idiomatic integration with the Windows operating system. It differentiates itself from traditional C/C++ by offering memory safety, from C# by providing direct, low-level access without a garbage collector overhead and comprehensive API coverage via metadata-based generation, and from Delphi and Python by focusing specifically on the Rust ecosystem and leveraging Rust's performance and safety guarantees. Its target market is Rust developers building Windows-native applications or components."
