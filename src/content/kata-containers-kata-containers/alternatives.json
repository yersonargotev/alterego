  "marketPositioning": "Kata Containers is positioned as a secure, production-ready container runtime that bridges the gap between traditional containers and Virtual Machines. It targets users and organizations requiring stronger workload isolation than standard container runtimes can provide, particularly for multi-tenant environments or running untrusted code. By using lightweight VMs, it offers enhanced security without the full overhead of traditional VMs, differentiating it from namespace/cgroup-based runtimes (like runC, crun) and offering a different isolation approach compared to user-space kernel runtimes (like gVisor). Its compatibility with standard container interfaces like CRI allows for easy adoption within existing container orchestration platforms."
