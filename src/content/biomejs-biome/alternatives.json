  "marketPositioning": "Biome positions itself as a modern, high-performance, unified toolchain for web projects, directly challenging the traditional setup involving separate tools like ESLint and Prettier. Its key differentiator is its implementation in Rust, offering significant speed advantages. It aims to simplify the development workflow by combining formatting and linting into a single tool with a unified configuration and command-line interface. While currently supporting a core set of web languages, its language support is growing. Its focus on speed, simplicity, and a cohesive developer experience through features like LSP support and detailed diagnostics sets it apart as a next-generation solution."
