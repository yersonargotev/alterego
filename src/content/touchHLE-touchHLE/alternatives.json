  "marketPositioning": "touchHLE is positioned as a niche, high-level emulator focused specifically on preserving and running applications from the early iPhone OS era. Unlike general-purpose development simulators (like Xcode Simulator) or broader emulation platforms, its core value lies in providing compatibility for legacy iPhone OS software. Its open-source nature further emphasizes a community-driven effort towards software history preservation, differentiating it from commercial or enterprise-focused virtualization solutions."
