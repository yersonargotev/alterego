  "marketPositioning": "libdatadog is positioned as a foundational, internal shared library within the Datadog observability ecosystem. It underpins Datadog's language-specific agents, particularly for performance-critical functions like continuous profiling, by providing a common, efficient core written in Rust. Its market positioning is tied to Datadog's overall strategy to offer a unified, high-performance observability platform across diverse technical stacks. The use of a shared Rust library likely enhances the consistency and efficiency of Datadog's data collection agents compared to solutions that might rely solely on language-specific implementations."
