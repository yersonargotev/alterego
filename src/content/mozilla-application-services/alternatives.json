  "marketPositioning": "mozilla/application-services is an internal, open-source project supporting the Firefox browser and its ecosystem. Unlike the proprietary, closed-source synchronization and service backends used by competitors like Chrome, Edge, and Safari, its open nature aligns with Mozilla's commitment to transparency and user control. Its development in Rust emphasizes a focus on building performant and secure foundational components for a privacy-centric browser. It positions Firefox as a browser whose core functionalities are built on inspectable, community-auditable code."
