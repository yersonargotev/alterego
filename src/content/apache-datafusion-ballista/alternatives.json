  "marketPositioning": "Apache Arrow Ballista is positioned as a modern, high-performance distributed query engine built in Rust and deeply integrated with the Apache Arrow ecosystem. It targets users who require scalable analytical query processing and prioritize performance, Rust development, and leveraging the efficiency of Arrow's columnar format, differentiating itself from broader platforms like Spark or database-centric solutions like ClickHouse, and emphasizing its foundation on Arrow compared to other distributed query engines like Trino or Dremio."
