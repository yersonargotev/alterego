  "marketPositioning": "Elodin is positioned as a modern, high-performance, code-first physics simulation platform specifically for the space and aerospace industries. It distinguishes itself through its use of a modern technology stack (Rust, Python, JAX, XLA for GPU acceleration), enabling fast and large-scale simulations (fleets, Monte Carlo). Its integration with flight software development components provides a more comprehensive toolchain for autonomous systems compared to purely simulation or astrodynamics packages. While established tools like STK, FreeFlyer, and GMAT offer extensive, validated features and broad industry adoption, Elodin targets users who prioritize programmatic control, flexibility, and leveraging modern hardware for performance, offering an open-source alternative with a distinct technical foundation."
