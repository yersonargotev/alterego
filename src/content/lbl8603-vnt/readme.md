5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on search results and general awareness in the networking space, **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard** are widely considered among the most well-known and used VPN protocols and software, both in open-source self-hosted scenarios and by commercial VPN providers. Tailscale and ZeroTier have also gained significant traction for their ease of use and mesh networking capabilities. Considering longevity, widespread adoption across various platforms and commercial services, and its use as a foundation for many other VPN products, **OpenVPN** is arguably the most historically well-known and widely deployed open-source VPN. WireGuard is rapidly gaining ground due to its performance and simplicity. For a broader "virtual networking" context including ease of use for remote access beyond traditional VPN clients, **Tailscale** and **ZeroTier** are very popular managed/partially-managed solutions. Given the project's focus on "convenient" and "internal network penetration," which aligns with simpler remote access and P2P scenarios, **Tailscale** and **ZeroTier** are highly relevant and well-known in that specific niche. However, as a general VPN tool alternative, **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard** are the most dominant protocols/software. Let's list both OpenVPN and WireGuard as the most well-known open-source alternatives, and Tailscale/ZeroTier as well-known alternatives focusing on ease of use and mesh networking.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    VNT positions itself as an "efficient and convenient" tool for remote networking and internal network penetration, highlighting simplicity and ease of use ("简便高效"). Unlike enterprise-focused solutions or complex VPN setups, VNT seems geared towards users who need a straightforward way to connect devices across different networks, potentially bypassing NAT without requiring extensive network configuration. Its use of a simple token for network identification suggests a focus on ease of setup. Compared to more established protocols like OpenVPN (known for flexibility but often complex setup) or WireGuard (known for speed and simplicity, but still requires key management), VNT appears to prioritize the "convenient" aspect, potentially abstracting some underlying complexities, perhaps similar to the user experience offered by solutions like Tailscale or ZeroTier but potentially with a focus on self-hosting or a simpler model. The inclusion of "internal network penetration" (内网穿透) directly addresses a common challenge that tools like Tailscale and ZeroTier also tackle with their NAT traversal capabilities. Its Rust implementation suggests a focus on performance and safety.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    VNT (Virtual Network Tool) is an open-source project written in Rust, designed to be an efficient and convenient solution for establishing virtual networks between geographically dispersed devices or machines located behind Network Address Translation (NAT). It provides VPN-like functionality specifically aimed at simplifying remote networking and enabling internal network penetration or NAT traversal. Users can connect devices to a virtual network using a simple shared token, allowing them to communicate as if they were on the same local network, facilitating remote access and resource sharing without complex firewall or router configurations. It supports peer-to-peer connections when possible, falling back to relay servers if direct connection fails, to optimize communication efficiency. VNT aims to offer a more user-friendly and streamlined experience compared to some traditional VPN setups, focusing on ease of deployment and use for creating virtual LANs across different network environments.
