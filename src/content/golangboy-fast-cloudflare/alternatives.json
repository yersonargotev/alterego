  "marketPositioning": "fast-cloudflare is a specialized, open-source tool focused specifically on identifying the fastest Cloudflare IP address for a user's location. While broader tools like Nmap can perform general network scanning, and others like CFScanner offer additional Cloudflare-specific features like filter checking, fast-cloudflare is positioned as a streamlined, performance-oriented utility dedicated to finding the optimal Cloudflare IP node for improved connection speed and access. Its implementation in Rust suggests a focus on efficiency."
