It focuses on efficiently displaying and navigating CSVs directly in the terminal, particularly useful for large files where full loading in other applications might be slow. While alternatives like qsv and csvkit offer broader data manipulation, csvlens specializes in the viewing aspect, providing a simple yet powerful way to inspect CSV content using familiar terminal commands and leveraging Rust for performance."
