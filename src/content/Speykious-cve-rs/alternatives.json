  "marketPositioning": "cve-rs occupies a highly niche position as a tool for demonstrating and exploring memory vulnerabilities within the Rust programming language by exploiting a compiler soundness bug using only 'safe' Rust code. It is distinct from traditional vulnerability scanners or code analysis tools that aim to find existing vulnerabilities. Its market is primarily developers and security researchers interested in Rust's memory safety guarantees and compiler behavior, positioning it as an educational and research tool rather than a conventional security product for securing arbitrary software or networks."
