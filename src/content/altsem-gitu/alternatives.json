  "marketPositioning": "Gitu positions itself as a fast, keyboard-centric Terminal User Interface (TUI) Git client. Its primary market is developers who prefer working within the terminal environment and are looking for a powerful, interactive Git client that goes beyond the standard command-line interface. By taking inspiration from Magit, it aims to offer a comprehensive suite of Git functionalities within the TUI, appealing to users who value efficiency and a text-based workflow but do not use Emacs or prefer a standalone TUI application over a GUI. It competes with other TUI clients like lazygit and tig by offering a potentially more complete 'porcelain' experience closer to that of Magit, while differentiating itself from graphical clients like GitKraken and SourceTree by remaining entirely within the terminal."
