  "mainFeatures": [
    "Replaces platform-specific executables with a single script containing descriptors.",
    "Transparently fetches, decompresses, and verifies the appropriate remote artifact.",
    "Written in Rust for performance and cross-platform compatibility.",
    "Includes tooling for generating DotSlash files for GitHub releases.",
    "Enables vendoring a specific version of a tool with minimal effect on repository size."

  "marketPositioning": "DotSlash positions itself as a simplified and lightweight alternative for executable deployment, focusing on fetching binaries on demand rather than traditional bundling or full environment virtualization. Its key strengths lie in its simplicity, minimal impact on source control size, and integration with platforms like GitHub releases, differentiating it from more comprehensive solutions like Docker, Flatpak, or Snap, and traditional bundling tools like PyInstaller or Paquet Builder which include the entire binary."
