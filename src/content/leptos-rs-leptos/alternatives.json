  "marketPositioning": "Leptos is positioned as a high-performance, full-stack web framework built in Rust, offering a compelling alternative to traditional JavaScript frameworks. It targets developers who value Rust's performance, memory safety, and type system for building reliable web applications end-to-end. Its key differentiators include fine-grained reactivity without a Virtual DOM for efficient updates, comprehensive full-stack capabilities with integrated server functions and tooling, and a focus on leveraging web standards. It competes with other Rust frameworks like Yew and Dioxus by offering a distinct reactivity model and a strong emphasis on the full-stack web experience, while also providing a Rust-based alternative to mainstream JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, and .NET-based Blazor."
