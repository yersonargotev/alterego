  "marketPositioning": "Subtensor is positioned as a specialized blockchain layer purpose-built for the Bittensor decentralized machine learning network. Unlike general-purpose blockchain platforms or broader blockchain frameworks, Subtensor is specifically designed to manage the unique consensus, data recording, and incentive mechanisms required for a network focused on decentralized artificial intelligence and the coordination of machine learning models across subnets. Its market position is centered on providing the core decentralized infrastructure for the Bittensor ecosystem, distinguishing itself through its direct support for incentivized machine intelligence and its role as the backbone for the network's dynamic structure."
