  "marketPositioning": "ClangQL occupies a niche in the code analysis market by offering a unique approach to querying C/C++ code. While other tools like CodeQL and CppDepend provide code querying capabilities, they use their own specialized query languages (QL and CQLinq, respectively). ClangQL differentiates itself by leveraging the familiar SQL-like syntax of the GitQL SDK, making it potentially more accessible to developers already comfortable with SQL. Its core strength lies in providing a database-querying paradigm applied to the structured representation (AST) of C/C++ code generated by Clang. This positions ClangQL as a specialized tool for users who prefer an SQL-based method for structural code inspection and analysis, distinct from broader static analysis platforms or general code search engines."
