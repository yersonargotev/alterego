  "marketPositioning": "Phira positions itself as a community-driven, open-source alternative to the popular mobile rhythm game Phigros. It directly competes by replicating and building upon Phigros's unique gameplay mechanics, while differentiating itself through its open nature, explicit support for custom and fanmade content, and multi-platform availability. This appeals to players seeking the Phigros experience with greater content flexibility and a collaborative development model, contrasting with the more curated and commercial approach of its direct inspiration and other proprietary rhythm games. Compared to broad platforms like osu! or StepMania, Phira offers a more focused experience tailored to the Phigros style."
