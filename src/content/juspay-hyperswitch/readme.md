1.  **Extracted Key Information:**
    *   **Project Name:** hyperswitch
    *   **Description:** An open source payments switch written in Rust to make payments fast, reliable and affordable.
    *   **Main Features:** Open source, written in Rust, connects with multiple payment processors with a single API, seamless payment processing (authorization, authentication, void, capture, refunds, chargeback handling), supports non-payment use cases (FRM, authentication), optimizes payment routing (success rate-based, rule-based, volume distribution, fallback, intelligent retry), unified SDK for various payment methods (cards, wallets, BNPL, bank transfers), supports diverse payment flows, provides a reusable core payment stack, allows customization, multi-tenant support, easy-to-write rules for routing, 100% control and automation on payments flow, developer-friendly, well documented, Docker available, provides a robust subscription feature, can automatically route payments based on volume, failure rate, country, etc., provides a user-friendly dashboard with analytics, offers high uptime and transaction per second capabilities.

2.  **Project Purpose:** Based on the description and features, the project's purpose is to provide an open-source, flexible, and robust payment orchestration layer that allows businesses to connect to and manage multiple payment processors through a single API, enabling features like smart routing, improved reliability, and reduced costs, effectively acting as a customizable payment switch.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Alternative Tools:**
    *   Proprietary Payment Gateways with advanced features (often include some orchestration capabilities): Stripe, Adyen, Checkout.com
    *   Dedicated Payment Orchestration Platforms (often work *with* gateways): Spreedly, IXOPAY, Corefy, Paydock, Zai, Paytently, Akurateco
    *   Other Open Source Payment Solutions (though true open-source payment switches/orchestrators are less common): Some basic payment gateway integrations or libraries exist, but a full open-source switch is a key differentiator for Hyperswitch. Sybrin (mentions open source blend).

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:** Globally, **Stripe** and **Adyen** are arguably the most well-known and widely used platforms in the payment processing space, often also offering features that overlap with payment orchestration, especially for platforms and marketplaces. While Spreedly and IXOPAY are prominent *dedicated* orchestration platforms, Stripe and Adyen have broader market recognition and extensive feature sets covering both processing and aspects of orchestration, particularly their offerings for platforms.

6.  **Market Positioning:** Hyperswitch positions itself as an *open-source* payment switch/orchestration platform. This is a key differentiator compared to most major alternatives like Stripe, Adyen, Spreedly, and IXOPAY, which are proprietary. Its open-source nature, built with Rust for performance and reliability, allows businesses more control and customization over their payment stack. While proprietary orchestration platforms exist, Hyperswitch competes by offering transparency, the ability to own the core infrastructure, and potentially lower costs by avoiding licensing fees, although support and maintenance costs would still apply for self-hosting. It directly competes with proprietary orchestration layers by offering a self-hostable, customizable alternative. It also positions itself as a potential "Stripe Replacement" in terms of providing a core payment layer and features like subscriptions, while allowing integration with *multiple* processors, including potentially Stripe itself. Its focus on being "fast, reliable and affordable" highlights its performance and cost-efficiency as benefits of the open-source approach and Rust implementation.

7.  **Expanded Description:** Hyperswitch is Juspay's composable, commercial open-source payments platform designed for merchants and brands. It functions as an enterprise-grade, transparent, and modular payment switch written in Rust, aimed at making payments fast, reliable, and affordable. Hyperswitch allows businesses to connect with multiple payment processors through a single API integration, enabling seamless payment processing workflows (authorization, authentication, void, capture, refunds, chargebacks) and supporting non-payment use cases like fraud and authentication providers. A key feature is its robust and customizable payment routing engine, which can optimize transactions based on factors like success rate, rules, volume distribution, and intelligent retries. It provides unified SDKs for various payment methods and offers a reusable core payment stack that businesses can own and tailor to their specific needs, reducing development effort in building a multi-processor setup. With features like multi-tenant support, a user-friendly dashboard with analytics, and high potential uptime, Hyperswitch positions itself as a powerful, flexible, and cost-effective open-source alternative to proprietary payment orchestration solutions, offering businesses greater control and automation over their payment flows.
