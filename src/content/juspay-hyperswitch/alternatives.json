  "marketPositioning": "Hyperswitch is positioned as a leading open-source payment switch and orchestration platform. Its key differentiator is being open-source, providing businesses with greater control, transparency, and customization compared to predominantly proprietary alternatives like Stripe, Adyen, Spreedly, and IXOPAY. By offering a reusable, Rust-based core payment stack, it aims to reduce the development effort and cost associated with integrating multiple payment processors while providing advanced features like smart routing and unified payment experiences. It directly competes with proprietary orchestration layers by offering a self-hostable and highly adaptable solution, aiming for high performance, reliability, and affordability."
