  "marketPositioning": "Pylyzer positions itself as a high-performance alternative in the Python static analysis and language server space, leveraging Rust for speed. It focuses on type checking and core language server features, aiming to compete on performance with existing tools like mypy and Pyright, while offering a potentially different analysis approach through its use of the Erg type checker. It differentiates from Rust-based linters like Ruff by prioritizing type analysis and LSP capabilities over broad linting/formatting rules."
