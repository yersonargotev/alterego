  "marketPositioning": "gxhash is positioned as a high-performance, non-cryptographic hashing algorithm whose primary differentiator is its claim to be 'the fastest'. It competes directly with other speed-optimized hashes like xxHash, CityHash, FarmHash, and MurmurHash, targeting use cases where maximum hashing throughput is essential. Its market appeal is centered around providing superior speed within the non-cryptographic hashing landscape."
