  "marketPositioning": "Salvo is positioned as a powerful and simplified web framework within the Rust ecosystem. It competes directly with other Rust frameworks like Actix Web, Rocket, and Axum by aiming for a balance between comprehensive features and ease of use. While Actix Web is often highlighted for raw performance and Axum for its modularity and integration with the Tokio ecosystem, Salvo's emphasis on a 'simplified design' suggests it targets developers who prioritize a smooth and less complex development experience without sacrificing the power needed for modern web applications. It aims to make Rust web development more accessible while leveraging Rust's core benefits of performance and safety."
