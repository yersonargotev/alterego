  "marketPositioning": "geektime-rust is positioned as a supplementary resource specifically for students enrolled in a commercial Rust programming course on the Geektime platform. Unlike general, freely available Rust learning resources such as The Rust Programming Language book, Rust by Example, or Rustlings, which serve a broad audience of Rust learners, this repository's primary value lies in its direct correlation with the specific curriculum and teaching style of the accompanying paid course. It is a code companion designed to be used in conjunction with the course content, rather than a standalone learning tool."
