        *   Main Features: Structured learning paths, video content, exercises, sometimes certifications, cover various levels from beginner to advanced.
        *   Website URL: e.g., https://www.udemy.com/courses/it-and-software/programming-languages/rust/ ; https://www.coursera.org/search?query=rust%20programming

5.  **Identify the most well-known alternative:**
    Based on search results and community mentions, "The Rust Programming Language" ("The Book") is widely considered the most well-known and official resource for learning Rust. Rustlings and Rust by Example are also very popular, especially for hands-on learning.

6.  **Analyze Market Positioning:**
    `geektime-rust` is a code repository specifically tied to a paid Rust course on the Geektime platform. Its market positioning is as a supplementary resource for students enrolled in that particular course. Unlike general resources like "The Book," "Rust by Example," or "Rustlings," which are standalone learning tools, `geektime-rust`'s value is primarily derived from the course content it accompanies. It's not a general-purpose Rust learning tool but a specific component of a commercial educational product. Its unique feature is its direct alignment with the Geektime course curriculum.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    `geektime-rust` is the official code repository for a Rust programming course offered on the Geektime online education platform. It contains code examples, exercises, and projects that are synchronized with the course curriculum, serving as a practical companion for students to follow along, experiment with, and deepen their understanding of the Rust concepts taught in the lessons. The repository is updated as the course content evolves.
