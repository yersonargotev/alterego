  "marketPositioning": "Wezterm positions itself as a modern, high-performance, cross-platform terminal emulator that integrates terminal multiplexing directly, differentiating it from traditional setups relying on separate tools like tmux or screen. By leveraging GPU acceleration and being built in Rust, it aims to provide a fast and smooth experience. Its extensive customization via Lua scripting appeals to power users seeking fine-grained control. While competing with other GPU-accelerated cross-platform emulators like Alacritty and Kitty, Wezterm's built-in multiplexer is a key feature. It competes with platform-specific leaders like iTerm2 (macOS) and Windows Terminal by offering broader OS support while aiming for a comparable or enhanced feature set, particularly in its integrated multiplexing and scripting capabilities. It targets users who desire a single, highly customizable, performant, and consistent terminal experience across diverse computing environments."
