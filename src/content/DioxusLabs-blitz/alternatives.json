  "marketPositioning": "Blitz is positioned as a high-performance, Rust-based rendering engine for HTML and CSS that leverages WGPU for direct GPU acceleration. Unlike frameworks that embed full, large browser engines (like Electron or Tauri using native webviews), Blitz aims to be a more lightweight and performant component, potentially targeting niche use cases such as game UI rendering or specialized graphical applications where fine-grained control over rendering and maximum performance are critical. It serves as a rendering library rather than a complete application framework."
