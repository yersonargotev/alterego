  "marketPositioning": "dbeel is positioned as a high-performance, distributed document database project leveraging a thread-per-core architecture for optimal efficiency on modern multi-core systems. Unlike established, production-ready document databases such as MongoDB or Couchbase, dbeel is currently a hobby/learning project. Its unique blend of a document model with performance-oriented thread-per-core design, inspired by databases like ScyllaDB, places it in a niche focused on exploring cutting-edge database implementation techniques rather than being a direct competitor in the current database market."
