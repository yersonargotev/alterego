  "marketPositioning": "JA4+ is positioned as the next-generation suite of network fingerprinting standards, succeeding and improving upon the widely adopted JA3. It differentiates itself by offering broader protocol support, a modular and human-readable fingerprint format for granular analysis, improved evasion resistance, and extensibility. It serves as a foundational technology for network security, providing advanced fingerprinting capabilities that can be integrated into various existing security tools and platforms (NSM, IDS/IPS, threat intelligence) to enhance visibility and threat detection in encrypted traffic. Its competition lies primarily with older, less comprehensive fingerprinting standards and the fingerprinting capabilities built into broader security platforms."
