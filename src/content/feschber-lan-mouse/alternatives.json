  "marketPositioning": "Lan Mouse is an open-source software KVM switch that enables users to effortlessly share a single mouse and keyboard across multiple computers connected on a local area network. Written in Rust for enhanced performance, it provides a seamless experience, similar to Apple's Universal Control, allowing you to control multiple PCs by simply moving your cursor to the edge of a screen. The project prioritizes ease of use and a maintainable architecture, with a focus on developing native user interfaces and aiming for interoperability with established software KVM tools like Deskflow and Synergy. All network traffic is encrypted using DTLS for security. As a free and open-source alternative, Lan Mouse stands out against proprietary options, offering robust mouse and keyboard sharing capabilities without licensing costs for personal or commercial use, while also seeking to innovate and collaborate within the software KVM landscape."
