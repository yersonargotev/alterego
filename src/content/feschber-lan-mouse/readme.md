2.  **Project Purpose:**
    The project "lan-mouse" aims to provide a free and open-source software solution for sharing a single mouse and keyboard across multiple computers connected to a local area network (LAN). It serves as a software-based alternative to hardware KVM switches, allowing users to control multiple machines seamlessly by moving the cursor between screens.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Alternatives:**
    Based on the purpose of mouse and keyboard sharing across a LAN, potential alternatives include other software KVM tools, both open-source and proprietary. Some well-known names in this space are Synergy, Mouse Without Borders, Barrier, Input Director, and ShareMouse.

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on search results and general recognition in the software KVM space, **Synergy** appears to be the most well-known and widely used alternative overall, although it is now primarily a commercial product with a complex history involving open-source roots and forks like Barrier. Mouse Without Borders is also very popular, especially among Windows users due to its ease of use and free nature.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    "lan-mouse" positions itself as a "Software KVM Switch / mouse & keyboard sharing software for Local Area Networks". Its key differentiators and market positioning points include being open-source, written in Rust for performance, focusing on ease of use and a maintainable implementation, having native frontends, and aiming for interoperability with existing tools like Deskflow/Synergy. Compared to proprietary solutions like Synergy and ShareMouse which require payment for full features or commercial use, lan-mouse offers its functionality freely under an open-source license (GPL-3.0 only). Compared to other open-source alternatives like Barrier (which is considered unmaintained by some) or Input Leap (a Barrier fork), lan-mouse is a newer project written in Rust, aiming for performance and modern implementation. Its explicit goal of interoperability with Deskflow/Synergy also suggests a desire to be part of and contribute to the broader software KVM ecosystem rather than being a siloed solution.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    Lan Mouse is an open-source software KVM switch that enables users to effortlessly share a single mouse and keyboard across multiple computers connected on a local area network. Written in Rust for enhanced performance, it provides a seamless experience, similar to Apple's Universal Control, allowing you to control multiple PCs by simply moving your cursor to the edge of a screen. The project prioritizes ease of use and a maintainable architecture, with a focus on developing native user interfaces and aiming for interoperability with established software KVM tools like Deskflow and Synergy. All network traffic is encrypted using DTLS for security. As a free and open-source alternative, Lan Mouse stands out against proprietary options, offering robust mouse and keyboard sharing capabilities without licensing costs for personal or commercial use, while also seeking to innovate and collaborate within the software KVM landscape.
