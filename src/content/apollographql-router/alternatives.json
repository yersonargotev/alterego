  "marketPositioning": "The Apollo Router is positioned as a high-performance, production-grade runtime for building and operating federated GraphQL APIs using Apollo Federation 2. Written in Rust for speed and efficiency, it serves as the core gateway component for routing and executing queries across distributed services. It targets organizations requiring a robust, scalable, and secure solution for managing complex GraphQL architectures in microservices environments, often within or alongside the broader Apollo GraphOS ecosystem. It competes with other GraphQL-native gateways and general API gateways that offer GraphQL capabilities, emphasizing its deep integration with Apollo Federation and its performance characteristics."
