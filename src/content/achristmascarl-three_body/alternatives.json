  "marketPositioning": "The `three_body` project is positioned as a rudimentary, code-focused implementation of the three-body problem simulation. It is likely aimed at developers or students interested in the core physics and implementing simulations in Rust, rather than users seeking a full-featured, user-friendly simulation environment for complex systems or detailed analysis. It occupies a niche at the basic or educational end of the N-body simulation software landscape."
