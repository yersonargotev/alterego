  "marketPositioning": "Carbonyl is positioned as a modern, high-fidelity terminal web browser that leverages the full power of the Chromium rendering engine. It differentiates itself from traditional text-based browsers by offering comprehensive support for modern web standards and APIs, providing a browsing experience closer to a graphical browser but within the terminal. Compared to other modern terminal browsers that use full engines, Carbonyl emphasizes performance and efficiency through its direct rendering approach. Its market niche is users who require full web functionality in a terminal environment, particularly where graphical interfaces are unavailable or impractical."
