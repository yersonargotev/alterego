  "marketPositioning": "Searcher-examples is positioned not as a direct competitor to general Solana development SDKs (like solana-web3.js or solana-rs), but as a supplementary, essential resource for developers specifically targeting MEV strategies on the Solana network using Jito Labs' specialized infrastructure. It serves as the primary code example kit for onboarding developers to the Jito Block Engine and Relayer, highlighting Jito's unique features like atomic transaction bundling and private transaction submission as the preferred method for sophisticated MEV searchers on Solana."
