  "marketPositioning": "Vaultwarden is positioned as a lightweight, open-source, self-hostable server alternative to the official Bitwarden server. It specifically targets users who want to self-host their password vault on resource-constrained devices while utilizing the full-featured and widely available official Bitwarden clients. Its compatibility with Bitwarden clients is a key differentiator compared to other self-hosted solutions with their own client ecosystems. It competes with the official Bitwarden self-hosted option by offering lower resource requirements and with proprietary cloud services by providing a self-hosted, privacy-focused alternative."
