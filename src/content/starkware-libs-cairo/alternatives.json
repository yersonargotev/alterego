  "marketPositioning": "Cairo is positioned as a specialized, Turing-complete programming language tightly integrated with the StarkNet/StarkEx ecosystem for building scalable dApps on Ethereum using STARK proofs. While other ZKP languages like Circom and Noir offer more proving-system flexibility, Cairo is optimized for the STARK architecture and the StarkNet platform. Compared to general-purpose smart contract languages like Solidity, Cairo is explicitly designed for verifiable computation from the ground up, aiming to provide a developer-friendly yet powerful environment for creating provable programs and scaling Ethereum."
