  "marketPositioning": "PPLSystem is a highly specialized proof-of-concept tool positioned in the niche area of advanced Windows offensive security research. It demonstrates a novel, non-traditional technique for injecting code into Protected Process Light (PPL) processes without relying on vulnerable drivers or common user-mode injection methods. Its uniqueness lies in leveraging NtDebugSystemControl and COM remoting via a livedump to achieve DLL mapping in a highly protected process context. It is a tool for researchers and advanced practitioners exploring cutting-edge bypass techniques rather than a general-purpose offensive security platform."
