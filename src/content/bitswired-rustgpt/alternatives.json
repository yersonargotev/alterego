  "marketPositioning": "RustGPT is positioned as an open-source, self-hosted web UI for LLMs, specifically highlighting its foundation in the Rust programming language and HTMX for a performance-oriented and architecturally distinct alternative to mainstream proprietary AI interfaces (like ChatGPT, Gemini) and other open-source UIs (often built with JavaScript frameworks). It targets users and developers seeking transparency, control, and an interest in the Rust/HTMX technology stack, offering a more focused feature set initially compared to broader platforms like LobeChat or Jan which support more models and features out-of-the-box but use different underlying technologies."
