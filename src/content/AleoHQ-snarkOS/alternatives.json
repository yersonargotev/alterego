  "marketPositioning": "snarkOS is positioned as a purpose-built decentralized operating system for zero-knowledge applications, forming the core of the Aleo network. It aims to provide a native environment for private and scalable dApps by integrating ZK proofs deeply into its architecture and consensus mechanism. While other platforms utilize ZK technology, snarkOS differentiates itself by offering a vertically integrated ZK-centric layer 1 blockchain specifically designed for this use case, rather than being a scaling solution or a privacy feature built on top of an existing, more general-purpose blockchain."
