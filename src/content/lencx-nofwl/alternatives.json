  "marketPositioning": "NoFWL is positioned as a user-friendly, open-source, cross-platform desktop application that wraps web services for a more integrated and enhanced experience. Unlike general browsers, it offers dedicated features and local data storage. While frameworks like Electron and Tauri provide the foundation for building such apps, NoFWL is an end-user product. Compared to web debugging proxies like Charles Proxy or Mitmproxy, NoFWL's primary focus appears to be on providing a richer user interface and potentially service-specific integrations for web applications, rather than detailed network traffic analysis."
