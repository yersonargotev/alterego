  "marketPositioning": "Adcache was positioned, albeit satirically, as an ad-supported DNS resolver, a concept contrary to prevalent ad-blocking DNS solutions. Its current position is that of a deprecated experimental project, providing source code for those interested in its unique, and likely legally questionable, ad-injection mechanism rather than serving as a production-ready or privacy-focused DNS service. It does not compete in the mainstream DNS or caching markets."
