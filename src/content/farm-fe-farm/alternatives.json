  "marketPositioning": "Farm positions itself as a high-performance web build tool leveraging Rust for extreme speed. Its key market differentiator is its explicit compatibility with the Vite ecosystem, aiming to attract developers who value Vite's development experience but seek even faster build times. It competes directly on speed with other Rust-based or performance-focused tools like Parcel, esbuild, and SWC, while aiming to integrate smoothly into workflows currently using or considering Vite."
