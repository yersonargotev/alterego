  "marketPositioning": "RustScan positions itself as a modern, high-speed port scanner focused on rapid initial port discovery. It aims to be faster than traditional scanners like Nmap for the initial port scan phase and complements them by providing seamless piping of results for deeper analysis. Its emphasis on speed, simplicity, and integration with established tools like Nmap differentiates it from more monolithic or solely speed-focused alternatives. It targets users who prioritize quick identification of open ports before performing more detailed network analysis."
