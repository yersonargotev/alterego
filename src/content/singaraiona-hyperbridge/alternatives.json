  "marketPositioning": "hyperbridge is positioned as a high-performance, specialized Rust library providing an unbounded, multi-producer, multi-consumer (MPMC) channel tailored for asynchronous applications. It competes directly with other async MPMC channel crates like async_channel and flume by emphasizing speed in the context of an unbounded, multi-consumer design. Unlike runtime-specific channels or MPSC variants, it offers a dedicated solution for efficient many-to-many asynchronous communication without inherent buffer limitations."
