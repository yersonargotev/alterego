  "marketPositioning": "Relay is positioned as a high-performance, scalable, and opinionated GraphQL client framework specifically for React applications. It differentiates itself through its strong emphasis on colocation of data dependencies using GraphQL fragments, a mandatory compile-time build step for query optimization, and strict adherence to GraphQL best practices for enforcing data consistency. While potentially having a steeper learning curve and being less flexible than alternatives like Apollo Client, its design is tailored for building complex, data-intensive applications that require robust performance and maintainability at scale, reflecting its origins and use in large-scale applications at Meta."
