  "marketPositioning": "Spice AI positions itself as an application-focused, portable data acceleration and query engine with integrated AI inference capabilities. Unlike centralized data virtualization/federation platforms (Trino, Denodo, Dremio) or broad processing engines (Spark), Spice emphasizes co-locating data access and acceleration directly with applications and AI agents to provide low-latency data for data-grounded AI and interactive experiences. Its unique combination of unified SQL, portable runtime, local data materialization/acceleration, and integrated AI APIs targets developers building AI-native applications that require fast, relevant data at the edge or within the application stack."
