  "marketPositioning": "GhostDriver is positioned as a specialized, open-source tool focused specifically on using the BYOVD technique for disabling security processes on Windows. While broader frameworks like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike offer a wide array of offensive capabilities including evasion, GhostDriver provides a targeted implementation of a specific, advanced evasion technique. Its open-source nature and implementation in Rust differentiate it from some commercial alternatives and provide transparency and potential for community contributions in its specific niche."
