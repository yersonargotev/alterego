  "marketPositioning": "gifski is positioned as a specialized, high-quality GIF encoder focused on achieving the best possible visual fidelity using advanced quantization techniques from libimagequant/pngquant. It competes with general-purpose tools like FFmpeg and ImageMagick by offering superior visual output for the challenging GIF format, particularly for converting video or rich image sequences. Its command-line/library nature targets developers and power users integrating it into workflows, differentiating it from GUI editors or simple online converters by emphasizing encoding quality."
