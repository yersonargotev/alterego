  "marketPositioning": "russh is positioned as a modern, safe, and performant native Rust library for developers building custom SSH applications. Unlike bindings to C libraries (like ssh2-rs to libssh2), it offers a pure Rust implementation, mitigating potential C interop risks and leveraging Rust's ownership and concurrency features. While other language-specific libraries like Paramiko (Python), Go's crypto/ssh, and Apache MINA SSHD (Java) serve similar purposes within their ecosystems, russh specifically targets the growing Rust community. Its focus on providing a low-level yet asynchronous API makes it suitable for building high-performance, reliable SSH clients and servers where memory safety and control over dependencies are critical concerns. Compared to the widely used end-user toolset like OpenSSH, russh is a developer tool providing the building blocks rather than a ready-to-use application suite."
