  "marketPositioning": "x8 is positioned as a specialized, high-accuracy command-line tool for hidden parameter discovery. Unlike broader web vulnerability scanners, it focuses solely on this specific reconnaissance task. Its use of advanced comparison logic (line-by-line page comparison, response code, and reflection analysis) for verification differentiates it from simpler wordlist-based fuzzers, aiming for greater reliability in identifying actual parameters. Written in Rust, it likely offers performance benefits appealing to users who prioritize speed and efficiency in their automated workflows, similar to other modern command-line fuzzers like ffuf."
