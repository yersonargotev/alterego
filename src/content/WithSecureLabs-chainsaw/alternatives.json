  "marketPositioning": "Chainsaw is a rapid, open-source command-line tool developed in Rust for quickly searching and hunting through Windows forensic artifacts, including Event Logs, MFT files, Shimcache, SRUM, and registry hives. Designed as a powerful \"first-response\" capability for blue teams, threat hunters, and incident responders, it provides a fast and lightweight method to identify threats within Windows event logs by leveraging built-in support for community-driven Sigma detection rules and custom Chainsaw rules. Unlike comprehensive digital forensics suites or large-scale SIEM systems, Chainsaw focuses on providing rapid triage and analysis of collected artifacts on a per-system basis. It allows users to search event logs using keywords and regex patterns, extract and parse specific alerts (like AV alerts), analyze system activity timelines from Shimcache and Amcache, examine the SRUM database, and dump raw artifact content. Its speed, portability (runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux), and focus on applying detection logic directly to raw or collected forensic data make it an essential tool for quickly gaining initial visibility into suspicious activity during incident investigations where traditional monitoring might be unavailable or insufficient."
