5.  **Identify the most well-known or widely used alternative overall:** Based on general industry recognition and search results indicating widespread use by metropolitan planning agencies and DOTs, **TransCAD** and the **PTV Vision Traffic Suite (Visum, Vissim)** appear to be among the most well-known and widely used proprietary tools in the transportation planning and traffic simulation space, particularly in a professional context. SUMO and MATSim are very well-known and widely used in research and open-source contexts. For a single "most well-known overall," considering both professional and academic use, it's difficult to definitively pick one, but PTV's suite and TransCAD have a strong commercial presence, while SUMO and MATSim are prominent open-source options. Let's list TransCAD and PTV Vissim as prominent examples of widely used proprietary alternatives.

6.  **Analyze the market positioning:** A/B Street positions itself as transportation planning and traffic simulation software specifically focused on making cities "friendlier to walking, biking, and public transit." This emphasis on active and public transportation modes, combined with its open-source nature and likely lower barrier to entry compared to commercial software, suggests a market position targeting urban planners, community advocates, researchers, and potentially even engaged citizens who want to explore and visualize the impact of changes from a non-car-centric perspective. Unlike some of the broader, more complex commercial tools that cover all modes extensively and are designed for large-scale professional studies (often with high licensing costs), A/B Street seems to carved out a niche focused on sustainable urban mobility and accessibility, potentially with a more accessible interface for non-experts.

7.  **Provide an expanded description of the given tool:** Based on the GitHub description, A/B Street is "Transportation planning and traffic simulation software for creating cities friendlier to walking, biking, and public transit." It allows users to model existing urban environments and simulate the effects of changes (like new bike lanes, bus routes, or pedestrian zones) on traffic flow and the viability of non-car transportation options. The project's focus is on advocating for and visualizing urban design changes that prioritize sustainable and active mobility, making it a tool for both analysis and public engagement in urban planning.
