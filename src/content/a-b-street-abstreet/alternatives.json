  "marketPositioning": "A/B Street is an open-source transportation planning and traffic simulation tool uniquely positioned to empower urban planners, advocates, and citizens in creating cities that prioritize walking, biking, and public transit. Unlike broader commercial tools that often cater extensively to car-centric analysis, A/B Street focuses specifically on sustainable mobility modes, offering a more accessible platform for visualizing and advocating for urban design changes that support active and public transportation."
