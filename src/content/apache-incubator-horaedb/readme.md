        *   Main features: Multi-dimensional data model, powerful query language (PromQL), pull-based architecture, service discovery, strong integration with Kubernetes, real-time alerting. Primarily a monitoring and alerting toolkit with a time-series database for short-term storage; often used with other backends for long-term storage.
        *   Website URL: prometheus.io

    *   **OpenTSDB:**
        *   Name: OpenTSDB
        *   Licensing: Open Source (GNU LGPLv2.1 or GPL-3.0)
        *   Supported platforms: Cross-platform (runs on top of HBase)
        *   Main features: Scalable and distributed, built on Apache HBase, designed for high data loads, supports plotting and alerting integration, decentralized architecture.
        *   Website URL: opentsdb.net (often linked from GitHub)

    *   **Graphite:**
        *   Name: Graphite
        *   Licensing: Open Source (Apache 2.0)
        *   Supported platforms: Cross-platform (consists of multiple components)
        *   Main features: Stores numeric time-series data, renders graphs on demand, simple data ingestion path, web UI and API for visualization, large ecosystem of data integrations.
        *   Website URL: graphiteapp.org (often linked from GitHub)

    *   **Apache HBase:**
        *   Name: Apache HBase
        *   Licensing: Open Source (Apache License 2.0)
        *   Supported platforms: Cross-platform (runs on Hadoop/HDFS or Alluxio)
        *   Main features: Distributed, scalable, versioned, non-relational (column-oriented), real-time read/write access to big data, automatic sharding and failover, Java API, REST/Thrift gateways. While not solely a time-series database, it is often used as a backend for time-series data storage, including by OpenTSDB.

5.  **Most Well-Known or Widely Used Alternative:**
    Based on search results and industry mentions, **InfluxDB** and **Prometheus** appear to be among the most popular and widely used time-series databases, particularly in cloud-native and monitoring contexts.

6.  **Market Positioning:**
    HoraeDB is positioned as a high-performance, distributed, cloud-native time-series database under the Apache Incubator. Its key differentiators, as highlighted in the provided metadata and associated website information, include its cloud-native architecture, focus on both time-series and analytical workloads, high scalability, cost-efficiency, and community-driven nature as an Apache project.
    Compared to alternatives:
    *   It competes directly with other open-source time-series databases like InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Prometheus, OpenTSDB, and Graphite.
    *   Unlike TimescaleDB, which is an extension of PostgreSQL, HoraeDB is a standalone database.
    *   While Prometheus is primarily a monitoring tool with time-series capabilities, HoraeDB is a more general-purpose time-series database.
    *   Compared to older systems like OpenTSDB (built on HBase) or Graphite, HoraeDB emphasizes a modern cloud-native design.
    *   Its positioning within the Apache Incubator signifies its potential for strong community governance and open development, which can be an advantage over tools with more restrictive open-source licenses or those primarily driven by a single commercial entity.
    *   The mention of handling both time-series and analytical workloads suggests it aims to provide a more integrated solution compared to databases solely focused on time-series data.

7.  **Expanded Description:**
    Apache HoraeDB (Incubating) is an open-source, high-performance, distributed, and cloud-native time-series database. Undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation, it is designed to handle large-scale time-series data with a focus on high scalability and cost-efficiency. The project aims to provide a unified platform for both time-series data ingestion and analytical querying, distinguishing itself with a cloud-native architecture and a community-driven development model.
