  "marketPositioning": "Rathole positions itself as a high-performance and lightweight open-source reverse proxy for NAT traversal, built in Rust. It directly competes with popular alternatives like frp and ngrok by offering superior throughput and lower resource consumption, making it particularly well-suited for performance-critical applications and resource-constrained environments such as embedded devices. Unlike managed services like ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel, rathole is a self-hosted solution, appealing to users who require more control and prefer open-source software. Its emphasis on performance, efficiency, and robust security features like mandatory tokens and optional encryption carves out a niche within the NAT traversal tool landscape."
