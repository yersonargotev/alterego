- Use @terminal with ripgrep (rg) to search for text or files quickly.

- Before creating or refactoring any component, page, custom hook, library, or utility:

    - If it exists, reuse or update it instead of creating a duplicate.

    - Only create new code if no suitable existing implementation is available.
